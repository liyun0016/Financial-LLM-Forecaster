The\nMayor and City Controller are elected through a citywide vote. City Council’s nine representatives are elected to\noffice by residents in each of their respective districts.\nThe Office of the City Controller is responsible for auditing all City expenditures in order to prevent wasteful or\nfraudulent practices. Additionally, the City Controller reviews and approves contracts and is also charged with\nreporting to the citizens of Pittsburgh, the Mayor, and City Council the state of the City’s fiscal condition. Every\nyear, the City Controller issues the Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, which provides detailed information\non Pittsburgh’s short-term and long-term financial outlook.\nCity Council proposes, deliberates, and votes on legislation governing and/or affecting the City. This body also\napproves appointments, regulates revenues and expenditures, and approves the final Operating and Capital\nBudgets. City Council is responsible for the introduction of legislation generated by the administrative branch of\nCity government and may also introduce legislation from individual Council members to the body as a whole.\nCity Council as a Body provides Council with centralized staff support under the direction of the City Clerk. The\nCity Clerk, with the help of the Records Management Division, serves as a centralized document and information\nresource to Council, all City Departments, and the residents of the City of Pittsburgh. The City Council Budget\nDivision monitors City finances and conducts independent analyses of City operations. It prepares and distributes\nto Council periodic reports on revenues, expenditures, and other trends relating to the fiscal condition of the City\nof Pittsburgh. It supervises and reviews City Council's annual operating and capital budgets and compiles special\nreports and executive summaries to assist Members in their deliberations.\nThe Office of the Mayor is the largest branch of the government of the City of Pittsburgh and is directly\nresponsible for much of the City’s daily operations. This work is performed by individual Departments, Offices,\nBureaus, and Commissions. The services provided by these entities range from public safety and public works to\ndebt management. Many of these departments focus on specific services. For example, the Department of Law\nacts as a legal advisor to the Mayor, City Council, and other Departments. Two units act as umbrella\norganizations. The Department of Public Safety Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Police, Fire,\nEmergency Medical Services, and Animal Care and Control, as well as the Office of Community Health and\nSafety. Similarly, the Department of Public Works Bureau of Administration oversees the Bureaus of Operations,\nEnvironmental Services, and Facilities.\nAdditionally, there are seven governmental units which fall within the Office of the Mayor in the City’s managerial\nhierarchy but whose sources of financing exist outside of the City’s General Fund. For this reason, these\nAuthorities are not included in the Operating Budget.\nA comprehensive visualization of the government of the City of Pittsburgh is included in the organization chart\npresented in this document.\n19\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\nWhat is the Operating Budget?\nThe Operating Budget functions as the financial plan for the current fiscal year. Reported within this document are\nfigures related to planned expenditures and projected revenues for the upcoming fiscal year. Expenditures are\nspread across all City Departments, Bureaus, and Elected Offices. These expenditures represent costs for the\nadministration and distribution of governmental services. These services include, but are not limited to: public\nsafety, refuse collection, snow removal, street paving, the issuance of permits and licenses, and maintenance and\nprogramming for local parks and community recreation centers. In addition, the General Fund also supports the\nroutine administration of local government that includes employee wages and health benefits, workers’\ncompensation benefits, utility and fuel usage, the funding of municipal pension plans, and debt service.\nThe City collects revenues to finance the costs associated with delivering services to residents. Revenues are\ncollected by the City from the levy of taxes, collection of fees related to the issuance of permits and licenses,\ncharges for services provided by City Departments, fines and forfeitures, intergovernmental revenues, and other\nrevenue generating mechanisms.\nThe Operating Budget combines information relating to expenditures and revenues, creating a plan as to what\ngovernmental services can be executed by the City and subsequently delivered to the public within a given fiscal\nyear. The detailed financial figures within this document illustrate both the cost incurred by the City of Pittsburgh in\ndelivering services to the public and the means through which these costs are financed.\nThe Operating Budget also stands as a policy document outlining the strategic initiatives of both the Mayor and\nMembers of City Council. Laws established by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania restrict how much money the\nCity of Pittsburgh may raise through the levy of taxes and charges for permits and licenses. As a result, the City of\nPittsburgh must balance the demands for services against the available resources that it can legally acquire\nthrough tax and non-tax revenue generating mechanisms. Given the reality of scarce resources, the City must\nprioritize initiatives and fund only those determined to be most essential and beneficial to the overall health of the\nCity. The level of funding allocated to individual Departments and programs within the City clearly exhibits\npriorities set by the City’s elected public officials.\nFinally, the Operating Budget can be viewed as a legally binding document. All of the costs incurred by the City of\nPittsburgh in providing day-to-day public services must be paid for out of the Operating Budget. Therefore, the\nCity of Pittsburgh must act within the confines of the financial details outlined within this document. The Operating\nBudget can only be altered through a series of formal processes, which parallel those enacted in the initial\ncreation of the plan.\nBasis of Accounting\nThe General Fund budget is adopted on a cash basis of accounting, meaning that the City of Pittsburgh\nrecognizes revenues when they are received and expenditures when they are paid.\nThe Fiscal Year\nThe City of Pittsburgh’s fiscal year begins on the first day of January and ends on the last day of December of\neach year. This can only be changed by ordinance.\nBalanced Budget Mandate\nThe City’s Home Rule Charter requires that the annual Operating Budget be balanced, with estimated revenues\nequal to or greater than estimated expenditures. Should revenues exceed expenditures at the end of a fiscal year,\nthe budget surplus is transferred into the City’s reserve fund balance.\n20\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\nThe City’s Fund Structure\nIn accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the City’s financial reporting system is organized on\na fund basis consisting of two major types of funds: governmental and fiduciary.\nGovernmental Funds\nGeneral Fund\nCapital Projects Fund\nCommunity Development Funds\nSpecial Revenues Funds\nFiduciary Funds\nPension Trust Fund\nAgency Funds\nThe General Fund is the main operating fund for the City. It includes most tax revenues and is used to sustain\nmost of the City’s day-to-day activities, including public safety, public works, parks, planning, and general\nadministration.\nThe Capital Projects Fund is used to fund construction and/or maintenance of any public property, facility, or\nprogram (such as buildings, park facilities, infrastructure, information technology systems) that is expected to\nprovide a long-term benefit to the City. All projects funded by debt should meet two requirements: a minimum\nvalue of $50,000 and a life expectancy greater than five years. Funding for the Capital Projects Fund comes from\nthree major sources: Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) funding, bonds, and State and Federal Funds. For more detail on\nthe Capital Budget and what it funds, please refer to the 2024 Capital Budget document.\nCommunity Development Funds are funded primarily by the federal Department of Housing and Urban\nDevelopment (HUD). These funds are earmarked for projects relating to housing, economic development, and\nhuman services needs in neighborhoods with a high concentration of low- to moderate-income households.\nSpecial Revenue Funds are funds in which a substantial portion of the proceeds or inflows are restricted or\ncommitted for a specific purpose. Examples of these include the Liquid Fuels Fund, the Pittsburgh Partnership\nFund, and the Grants Fund. While they are included in this document, the City only sets formal appropriations for\ntwo of the funds: the Stop the Violence Fund, and the Parks Tax Fund. Although many of these include the word\n“trust” in their titles, this is more of an informal recognition that the funds are designated for special purposes; the\nfunds are not held by any trustees or custodians.\nFiduciary Funds are used to account for resources held for the benefit of parties outside the government. These\nresources are not available to support the City of Pittsburgh’s own operations and are custodial in nature. The\nCity’s pension plans and its agency funds fall under this type of fund.\n• The City administers three pensions for full time employees: one for police officers, a second for\nfirefighters, and a third for municipal employees.\n• Agency funds include accounts held for employee benefits, payroll withholding, escheats, and tax\nrefunds. The Workers Compensation VEBA (Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Account), the OPEB (Other\nPost-Employment Benefits) Trust Fund, and Real Estate Tax Refunds Trust Funds are examples of\nFiduciary Funds.\nBudget Allocations\nThis budget document divides total expenditures across the Elected Offices, Departments, and Bureaus that\ncomprise the government of the City. Individual divisions carry out unique tasks.\n21\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\nThe City utilizes a hierarchical chart of accounts to distribute funds to each Department, Bureau, Agency, and\nElected Office. These accounts are organized by levels of detail, with the individual object accounts being the\nmost specific:\nFund ... Cost Center ... Subclass ... Object Account\nThe legal appropriations in the Operating Budget refer to the General Fund, which is coded as 11101.

Object accounts are\nthe most detailed level to which the City of Pittsburgh budgets.\nExpenditures are both budgeted and recorded using the account string depicted below. The account string begins\nby identifying the fund, followed by the cost center (City division), subclass (expenditure category), object account\n(expenditure category detail), and fiscal year. Below is an example account string that represents expenditures\nrelated to postage for the Department of Finance.\n11101.107000.56.56105.2024\n11101 107000 56 56105 2024\nGeneral Dept. of Supplies Postage Fiscal\nFund Finance Year\nWhat Are the City's Sources of Revenues?\nAnnual City of Pittsburgh revenue is generated by both tax and non-tax sources. There are seven subclasses.\nRevenues\n41 Tax Revenue\n42 License and Permit Revenue\n43 Charges for Services\n44 Fines and Forfeitures\n45 Intergovernmental Revenue\n46 Interest Earnings\n47 Miscellaneous Revenues\nTax Revenue\nTaxes comprise the majority of City of Pittsburgh revenues. In addition to wage and property taxes, there are\nmany that are generated by the wide range of services, institutions, and entertainment available within the City.\nThey are collected from both residents of the City of Pittsburgh as well as nonresidents, when appropriate.\nReal estate taxes are the single largest source of tax revenue. The City collects them on behalf of the City, School\nDistrict, and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. Real estate taxes are levied on land and buildings located within\nthe City of Pittsburgh. Assessments are conducted at the county level by the Allegheny County Office of Property\nAssessments and the tax is collected based on the fair market value of property. As of 2023, the City real estate\ntax rate is 8.06 mills, the School District real estate tax rate is 10.25 mills, and the Carnegie Library real estate tax\nrate is 0.25 mills. Tax relief is provided through various programs including the Homestead Exemption (Allegheny\nCounty Act 50 of 1998) and Senior Tax Relief (Allegheny County Act 77 of 2000).\nOther sources of tax revenue for the City of Pittsburgh are the Earned Income Tax, the Payroll Preparation Tax,\nthe Parking Tax, the Local Service Tax, the Amusement Tax and Non-Resident Sports Facility Usage Fee, the\nDeed Transfer Tax, the Public Service Privilege Tax, and the Institution and Service Privilege Tax.\nEarned Income Tax is a conventional 3 percent wage tax applied to City and School District residents who earn\nwages, salaries, tips, bonuses, or other net profits in a given year. City residents pay a 1 percent City tax and a 2\npercent School District tax. Interest, dividends, active duty pay from the Armed Forces, pensions, social security,\nand capital gains are commonly excluded.\nThe Payroll Preparation Tax was initiated following the City of Pittsburgh’s entry into Act 47 in 2003 and is levied\nat the rate of 0.55 percent on the gross payroll of employers and the distribution of net income from self-employed\nindividuals, members of partnerships, associations, joint ventures or other entities who perform work or provide\nservices within the City of Pittsburgh. Nonprofit and other charitable organizations are excluded from this tax.\n23\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\nFinally, the Parking Tax is collected from users of private and public parking facilities located within the City of\nPittsburgh. A portion of the Parking Tax is dedicated to the City of Pittsburgh’s pension fund until 2051.\nIn 2022, actual tax revenue totaled $537,692,183, or 76.5 percent of total City revenue.\nCity of Pittsburgh voters approved a referendum in 2019 to add 0.50 mills to the real estate tax to collect funds for\nthe improvement of the City's parks. These funds are not deposited into the General Fund. Please see the Stop\nthe Violence Trust Fund section for more information.\nNon-tax Revenue\n“Non-tax revenue” is a catch-all term referring to funding mechanisms utilized by the City of Pittsburgh that do not\ndirectly involve the levying of taxes. Residents may be familiar with examples such as building construction\npermits and liquor and malt beverage licenses. However, there are other types of non-tax revenue, such as\ninterest earnings on investments, that are less visible. Generally, the two largest subclasses of non-tax revenue\nfor the City of Pittsburgh come from intergovernmental sources and license and permit fees.\nEach year, the City of Pittsburgh receives funding from federal, state, and local government sources in the form of\ngrants, aid, and reimbursements for services performed. For example, the Liquid Fuels Tax object account\nconsists of funds received from the state and offsets some of the costs of road maintenance and road salt. Most\nintergovernmental funding comes from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the form of pension aid. Local\nentities, such as the Pittsburgh Parking Authority and the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority, and federal\nagencies also contribute to intergovernmental revenue. In utilizing this funding, the City's goal is to enhance the\nquality of municipal services and reduce the City's financial burden.\nMany City departments provide various services for which rent or fees are charged. Examples of these fees\ninclude payments for safety inspections, copying City documents, rents from City properties, and the use or sale\nof rights of way. In addition, the City is compensated for services provided to other municipalities and\ngovernmental entities. For example, Emergency Medical Services collects fees after it transports individuals to\nreceive medical care.\nIn 2022, actual non-tax revenue totaled $165,191,649, or 23.5 percent of total City revenue.\nHow Does the City Spend Money?\nThe tax and non-tax revenue collected annually by the City of Pittsburgh is used to provide services to residents\nranging from refuse pick-up to the regular maintenance of capital assets. Expenditures are monitored by\ndepartment or division and by subclass.\nMajor expenditures include health insurance costs, pension payments, and workers’ compensation claims for City\nof Pittsburgh employees. The Operating Budget also pays the principal and interest costs associated with past\nand current issuance of debt generated by previous and ongoing capital projects and other programs. The chart\nbelow illustrates historic costs associated with debt service, pension and other post-employment benefits (OPEB)\ncontributions, health insurance and workers’ compensation.\n24\n)snoilliM(\n$\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\nSelect Major Expenditures, 2018-2022\n150,000,000\n100,000,000\n50,000,000\n0\nH e\nalt Wh I on rs ku er ra\ns'\nn Cc e o m p e Pn s\ne\na nti sio on n a n d O P E B D e bt S ervic e\n2018 2019 2020\n2021 2022\nHealth Insurance\nThese expenditures are categorized within the Personnel – Employment Benefits subclass.

Legal and settlement expenses\nremain budgeted in the Department of Human Resources and Civil Service with accounts organized as follows:\nWorkers' Compensation\n52301 Medical - Workers' Compensation\n52305 Indemnity - Workers' Compensation\n52309 Legal - Workers' Compensation\n52314 Workers' Compensation Settlement\n52315 Workers' Compensation Fees\nPension & OPEB\nThe City of Pittsburgh operates three pension plans for retired police, fire, and municipal employees. \"Other post-\nemployment benefits\" refers to benefits, such as health insurance, that are provided to qualifying retired City\nworkers. These expenditures are housed within the Personnel – Employment Benefits subclass in the Department\nof Finance and are organized via the following individual accounts:\n25\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\nPension and OPEB\n52401 Pension Contribution\n52404 Retiree Contribution\n52407 Widow(er) Contribution\n52410 Survivor Contribution\n52413 Additional Pension Fund\n52416 Early Retirement Healthcare\n52419 Retired Police Officer\n52422 Retired Firefighters\n52423 Retired EMS\n52605 Retirement Severance\n52901 OPEB Contribution\nDebt Service\nDebt service is defined as payments made to the principal and interest balances of previously issued municipal\nbonds in order to ensure their timely retirement. Debt service exists as its own subclass within the Department of\nFinance and is composed of the following accounts:\nDebt Service\n82101 Interest Expense - Bonds\n82103 Principal\nBudget Creation Process\nThe operating budget development cycle begins in late spring, when the Office of Management and Budget\n(OMB) forwards a memorandum detailing the budget preparation process and general high level expectations,\npolicy goals, and citywide strategic initiatives to all City divisions. OMB also holds public meetings, as required by\nCity Code.\nAfter receiving baseline budgets from OMB, individual divisions work with their budget analysts to draft and submit\nproposals. Each division presents budget proposals to OMB. These proposals include current year achievements,\nrequests for general and project-specific funding, and personnel position changes. The Mayor reviews the\nproposals to ensure that requests align with citywide goals and strategic plans/initiatives and decides which, if\nany, should be funded.\nThe Mayor releases a preliminary budget at the end of September. OMB hosts additional public meetings to\ngarner feedback. If fiscal conditions allow for changes, revisions are made. When the proposals and the Mayor’s\nstrategic initiatives are aligned, the Mayor formally submits both budgets to City Council in November.\nCity Council reviews the budget and holds a number of meetings and televised hearings with each division. After\nconsideration of public input and Member priorities, City Council makes changes to the budget and then holds a\nvote to adopt the budget. This must occur before December 31st. Failure to enact a budget prior to January 1st of\nthe new year means that the City cannot pay any vendors, cannot undertake any projects, and cannot (subject to\ncollective bargaining agreements) pay any employees. The last time a budget was not approved before\nDecember 31st was 1931.\nUpon adoption, OMB is responsible for implementing and overseeing the City of Pittsburgh’s Operating and\nCapital Budgets. Throughout the fiscal year, OMB monitors the City’s expenditures and revenues, provides\nlegislative oversight on any matters related to the budget, and oversees budget transfers and adjustments.\nAnalysts in OMB prepare quarterly reports on the performance of major revenue sources and expenditure\ncategories, reports on key factors driving the budget, reports on cash flow, and brief updates on important\nmanagement initiatives.\n26\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\nFive-Year Financial Forecast\nIn addition to developing the budget, OMB and the Department of Finance are responsible for estimating both\nexpenditures and revenues for the four years following the next fiscal year. Together, these estimates comprise\nthe five-year financial forecast reported in the budget document.\nThe five-year forecast allows City Officials to evaluate the fiscal health of the City for a longer period of time. This\naids in identifying any future trends related to revenues and/or expenditures that may have an immediate or long-\nterm impact on City operations. In addition, the five-year plan is used by City decision makers when planning for\nlong-term strategies, formulating departmental and citywide initiatives, and developing new policies that might\nresult in a financial impact. The financial forecast is an essential tool in maintaining financial discipline, thus\nensuring the delivery of essential services to residents of the City of Pittsburgh.\nRevenue Forecast\nRevenues represent the available resources afforded to the City to carry out basic administrative operations and\ndeliver services to City residents. The ability of the City of Pittsburgh to generate revenue is governed by the\nrights afforded to the City under its Home Rule Charter and by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\nProjected future year expenditures are directly influenced by future year revenues projections.\nThe Department of Finance utilizes a variety of techniques and information sources to develop revenue forecasts.\nPrevious years’ financial data is used to forecast growth for major tax and non-tax revenues. Monthly and end-of-\nyear financial data related to all revenues are archived and updated in the City’s enterprise resource planning\n(ERP) system. This information is then analyzed through statistical methods to ascertain growth in each revenue\nline. Where applicable, the City then applies a growth rate to each revenue line.\nIn addition to the previous years’ financial data, the City consults with IHS Markit to forecast regional economic\nvariables. These economic variables help to inform how various aspects of the economy can affect revenue\ngenerating activity in the City. The City also incorporates data from federal government agencies such as the\nBureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics and organizations such as Fannie Mae, the\nNational Association of Realtors, and RealSTATs.\nRevenue projections are finalized after a series of meetings with various stakeholders related to the City of\nPittsburgh’s Operating Budget. The City Controller verifies that budgetary assumptions and estimates are\ndeveloped in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and that revenue assumptions are\nreasonable. Following consensus by all stakeholders in the budget development process, the revenue projections\nare finalized and incorporated into the five-year financial forecast.\nExpenditure Forecast\nOMB is responsible for developing the expenditure projections for the five-year forecast. To develop these\nforecasts OMB first enters all known future year expenditures into its budget management software. These known\nexpenditures are those that are either contractual (professional service contracts, debt service payments, pension\ncontributions, etc.) or generally predictable (staffing levels in each department, citywide salary increases, etc.).\nOMB then develops forecasts which consider past year expenditure data and future growth, strategies, and\ninitiatives. While most costs remain relatively static some expenditures lines, such as healthcare and fuel, are\nsubject to growth in future years. These increases are largely a product of costs rising in the private market. This\nis accounted for in the financial forecast by applying a percentage growth each year based on trend,\nLastly, the Directors of each City division present any requests that are not captured by the methods described\nabove. These requests are often related to software, equipment, or personnel and are regarded to be essential in\nachieving the goals or augmenting the services of each individual Department. OMB compiles all such requests\nand evaluates how they relate to the Mayor’s strategic initiatives. Subject to available funds, those requests that\nfall in line with the citywide initiatives are funded in each respective division’s budget in the five-year forecast.\n27\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\nHow to Read the Budget\nThroughout this budget document, financial data is illustrated in a variety of ways. In general, each separate\nsection of the document reports the same financial data. The level of detail is the only substantial difference\nbetween each report within a section.\nDepartmental Sections\nThe most detailed and specific illustration of the General Fund Operating Budget financial data can be found in\nthe Departmental Sections of the document. This section details funds by subclass and account that have been\nappropriated to each individual division. The following are the different components that in aggregate make up the\nDepartmental Sections of the Operating Budget.\n28\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Budget Guide\nOrganization Chart\nThe organization chart is a visual depiction of the functional areas within each City Department, Agency, Bureau,\nor Elected Office that are responsible for the execution of services and programs. The chart is very general; with\nthe exception of directors or other managers, the chart does not identify individual positions.\nDepartmental Overview\nAt the beginning of each departmental section, readers will find a Mission Statement which defines the\norganization. The Mission Statement is followed by an overview that provides a detailed description of the\ndepartment. This section of the narrative describes different functional areas within each Department, Agency,\nBureau, or Elected Office and their associated services or programs. Current year accomplishments are listed.\nPosition Summary\nThe position summary lists all of the budgeted jobs within the organization. The full-time equivalent, or “FTE,”\nrepresents the number of full-time workers in the position. The “Rate/Grade” category indicates how an\nemployee’s pay level is calculated. Grade and step plans for non-union employees and AFSCME 2719 employees\ncan be found as an appendix to this document. For full time positions, a “12” in the “Hours/Months” column\nindicates that the position is budgeted for all 12 months in the year. Smaller numbers indicate a position starting or\nending mid-year. For part time positions, the number in this column represents budgeted hours of work. The\n“Budget” column highlights the total amount, in dollars, that is allocated to pay all personnel in that position. The\n“Vacancy Allowance” adjusts the subclass expenditures to account for savings associated with vacant positions\nthroughout the year. A summary from 2023 is also included to facilitate comparisons.\nSubclass Detail\nThis portion of the departmental budget includes 2022 actual expenditures and budget numbers at the subclass\nand object account level. For example, the general “Professional and Technical Services” subclass will highlight\nthe appropriation amounts for specific accounts, such as “Administrative Fees,” “Workforce Training,” and\n“Computer Maintenance.” Readers can easily compare budgeted expenditures from 2023 with budgeted\nexpenditures for 2024. The final columns shows the difference and percent difference between the 2023 and 2024\nbudgeted amounts.\nUnder the Personnel – Salaries & Wages subclass, there are several important details. Regular salary represents\nthe total base pay for the organization. Longevity pay is awarded to employees in certain collective bargaining\nagreements based on seniority and tenure. Salary allowances are used to pay for part-time, temporary, or\nseasonal workers, as well as student interns. When uniform allowances are paid directly to employees, their costs\nare listed accordingly. Leave Buyback represents sick leave hours that can be “sold back” to the City. Premium\nPay appropriations compensate for overtime hours. Reimbursements are funds from outside sources that are\nused to offset certain position expenses.\nFive-Year Forecasts\nFinally, the five-year forecast allows readers to consider what the City expects to spend in the future. In addition to\nthe 2024 budget, there are projections for 2025 through 2028. The percent change from the prior year is included\nas a reference point.\nNote for Fund Accounts\nFor special revenue accounts that are included in the Operating Budget, the Fiscal Year 2024 summary is\ncomposed of the “Projected Beginning Balance” for January 1, 2024, anticipated revenues and expenditures, and\nthe “Projected Ending Balance” for December 31, 2024. These funds carry over from year to year. A position\nsummary follows when appropriate.\n29\nFive-Year\nFinancial Forecast\n30\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Five-Year Financial Forecast\nTarget Budget\n2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028\nEstimate Budget Forecast Forecast Forecast Forecast\nREVENUES\nReal Estate Tax $ 151,121,357 $ 151,837,378 $ 152,795,704 $ 153,923,913 $ 155,173,913 $ 156,513,449\nEarned Income Tax 130,325,783 136,190,443 142,046,631 148,438,729 155,266,910 161,632,825\nPayroll Preparation Tax 74,104,792 76,327,936 78,236,134 79,957,329 81,716,390 83,350,718\nParking Tax 49,828,006 51,554,031 53,627,771 55,581,123 57,609,383 59,594,838\nRegional Asset District Tax Relief 25,233,144 25,751,367 26,277,833 26,817,174 27,349,108 27,894,308\nDeed Transfer Tax 62,205,398 59,133,757 60,086,254 61,054,092 62,037,520 62,037,520\nAmusement Tax 18,487,118 18,882,489 19,451,222 19,940,901 20,413,358 20,955,390\nLocal Service Tax 15,757,421 15,737,659 15,768,351 15,626,436 15,485,798 15,349,423\nFacility Usage Fee 4,175,925 4,364,463 4,464,846 4,567,537 4,672,590 4,780,060\nTelecommunications Licensing Tax 1,145,168 1,156,620 1,168,186 1,179,868 1,191,666 1,203,583\nInstitution Service Privilege Tax 450,413 460,644 467,925 476,709 494,611 513,193\nNon-Profit Payment for Services 426,108 438,891 449,864 459,761 469,875 479,273\nOther Taxes — — — — — —\nLicenses and Permits 16,393,633 17,059,497 19,066,886 19,483,734 19,921,066 20,334,521\nCharges for Services 34,832,127 41,223,252 41,974,788 42,644,929 43,318,711 44,074,492\nFines and Forfeitures 8,504,100 8,691,404 8,908,689 9,104,681 9,304,984 9,491,083\nIntergovernmental Revenue 42,228,758 42,015,764 42,438,921 42,949,460 43,989,939 43,989,939\nInterest Earnings 16,883,166 16,545,503 16,049,138 15,939,547 15,831,561 15,725,169\nMiscellaneous Revenues 50,781,352 46,843,825 369,231 377,292 385,531 393,186\nTotal Revenues $ 702,883,769 $ 714,214,923 $ 683,648,373 $ 698,523,214 $ 714,632,914 $ 728,312,970\nEXPENDITURES\nSalaries $ 272,321,347 $ 291,780,311 $ 298,765,642 $ 302,663,332 $ 313,116,669 $ 323,133,403\nHealth Benefits 67,912,337 67,198,486 70,986,339 75,071,723 78,469,937 82,835,259\nWorkers' Comp. 16,847,452 16,760,467 16,806,906 16,855,202 16,880,316 16,899,500\nPension & OPEB 109,088,565 113,625,628 114,197,218 115,081,245 115,975,852 116,881,196\nOperating Departments 133,964,130 125,797,873 104,995,260 105,836,198 106,854,935 109,561,206\nDebt Service 62,538,120 69,390,272 74,404,315 79,023,162 48,176,521 53,298,214\nTotal Expenditures $ 662,671,951 $ 684,553,037 $ 680,155,681 $ 694,530,863 $ 679,474,230 $ 702,608,777\nOPERATING RESULT $ 40,211,818 $ 29,661,886 $ 3,492,692 $ 3,992,351 $ 35,158,684 $ 25,704,193\nBEGINNING RESERVE FUND\nBALANCE $ 149,708,106 $ 152,238,279 $ 134,037,317 $ 108,944,597 $ 80,855,555 $ 81,162,637\nTransfer to PAYGO (15,051,210) (22,000,000) (4,500,000) (4,000,000) (6,100,000) (6,500,000)\nTransfer to Early Childhood\nCommunity Facilities Fund (505,060) — — — — —\nTransfer to Housing\nOpportunity Fund (10,000,000) (10,000,000) (10,000,000) (12,500,000) (12,500,000) (12,500,000)\nTransfer for Housing Issuance — (2,500,000) (2,500,000) (2,500,000) (2,500,000) (2,500,000)\nTransfer to Stop the Violence Fund (8,698,375) (9,852,848) (11,585,412) (13,081,393) (13,751,602) (14,294,289)\nTransfer to Tech.

Prior to the county-wide reassessment effective in 2013, the total assessed value of\nproperty in the City grew by approximately 1.2 percent on average per year since 2003. The county-wide\nreassessment led to appeals, most notably for non-residential property, and the total assessed value decreased\nby 7.8 percent in 2014. Since then, the total assessed value of property has grown by 1.1 percent on average per\nyear, more in line with historical growth.\nThe largest taxpayer incentives that reduce current year real estate tax liability are the homestead exemption, the\nAllegheny County Act 77 of 2000 property tax relief (for senior citizens who meet certain requirements), and the 2\npercent early-filer discount. Non-profits are exempt from this tax. Real estate tax incentives for future years are\nestimated as an average percentage of tax liability based on data since the reassessment. Total real estate tax\nrevenues are forecast to increase by 0.8 percent each year through 2028.\nEarned Income Tax\nTotal earned income tax revenues are budgeted at $136.2 million in 2024, an estimated 7.3 percent increase over\nthe prior year. The earned income tax is a 1.25 percent levy on the wages and net profits of residents of the City\nof Pittsburgh. The earned income tax forecast projects tax year liabilities based on a 3.0 percent growth rate, with\na downward adjustment for the City of Pittsburgh, and splits current and prior year liabilities based on historical\ncollections. Total earned income tax revenues are forecast to increase by 4.4 percent each year through 2028.\nPayroll Preparation Tax\nTotal payroll preparation tax revenues are budgeted at $76.3 million in 2024, an estimated 16.0 percent increase\nover the prior year. The payroll preparation tax is levied at a rate of 0.55 percent on the gross payroll of employers\nand net income from self-employed individuals, members of partnerships, associations and joint ventures who\nperform work or provide services within the City of Pittsburgh. Non-profits an exempt from this tax. The payroll\n40\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Revenue\npreparation tax forecast uses total non-farm wages for Allegheny County to forecast future revenues. Total non-\nfarm wages for Allegheny County are forecast to increase by 4.0 percent on average. Total payroll preparation tax\nrevenues are forecast to increase by 2.2 percent each year through 2028.\nParking Tax\nTotal parking tax revenues are budgeted at $51.6 million in 2024, a 1.9 percent decrease from the prior year. The\nparking tax is levied at a rate of 37.5 percent on fees charged for parking or storing cars within the City of\nPittsburgh. The parking tax forecast uses a multivariate regression with collections as the dependent variable and\nthe tax rate and gross Allegheny County product as independent variables. Estimated gross Allegheny County\nproduct is the total value of goods produced and services provided in the county, and serves as a broad economic\nindicator of activity in and around the City. Total parking tax revenues are forecast to increase by 3.7 percent each\nyear through 2028.\nDeed Transfer Tax\nDeed transfer tax revenues are budgeted at $59.1 million in 2024, an estimated 13.7 percent decrease compared\nwith the prior year. This decrease is related to fewer property transactions in comparison to last year as a result of\nrising interest rates. The tax is levied at a rate of 3 percent on real property transfers within the City of Pittsburgh.\nThe total tax paid, which is typically split between the buyer and seller of a property, is 5% as of 2020, as the state\nand school board each also levy 1% taxes of their own.\nThe deed transfer tax forecast (provided by IHS Markit) uses a multivariate regression with collections as the\ndependent variable and three independent variables. The first independent variable is the residential tax base,\nwhich consists of existing single-family home sales multiplied by the average price of an existing single-family\nhome. The other independent variables are the tax rate and a dummy variable for years in which the sale of a\nnon-residential property exceeded $100 million. Total deed transfer tax revenues are forecast to increase by 1.2\npercent on average each year over the next five years.\nRegional Asset District Tax Relief\nRegional Asset District tax relief is budgeted at $25.8 million in 2024, an estimated 3.3 percent increase over the\nprior year. This relief, created by Pennsylvania Act 77 of 1993, provides the City of Pittsburgh with a percentage of\n1/4 of the 1 percent additional sales tax in Allegheny County. The City of Pittsburgh’s percentage is determined by\na formula that compares the City’s tax revenues and the market value of property per capita with that of all\nmunicipalities in Allegheny County. Retail sales (a proxy for sales tax collections) are forecast to grow by 3.1\npercent on average over the same period. Act 77 tax relief is forecast to increase by 2.0 percent each year\nthrough 2028.\nAmusement Tax\nTotal amusement tax revenues are budgeted at $18.9 million in 2024, an estimated 9.2 percent increase over the\nprior year. The amusement tax is levied at a rate of 5 percent on the gross admission to events that provide\nentertainment within the City of Pittsburgh, excluding non-profit performing arts organizations. Amusement tax\ncollections are primarily motivated by sporting events within the City. Revenues from the three professional sports\nteams have historically comprised 70 percent of amusement tax revenues on average per year. Revenues from\nopposing teams and non-resident performers comprise the remainder of the amusement tax revenues. A sports\nteams and clubs economic indicator is used to forecast 70 percent of amusement tax revenues. The remaining 30\npercent is forecast with consumer price index (inflation) to generate a more conservative forecast. Total\namusement tax revenues are forecast to increase by 2.6 percent each year through 2028.\n41\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Revenue\nLocal Service Tax\nTotal local service tax revenues are budgeted at $15.7 million in 2024, an estimated 3.2 percent increase over the\nprior year. The local service tax is a weekly tax of $1 per employee working within the City of Pittsburgh earning\ngreater than $12,000 annually. The local service tax forecast uses annual employment forecasts for the City of\nPittsburgh to project revenues. Total local service tax revenues are forecast to decrease by 0.6 percent per year\nthrough 2028.\nNon-Resident Sports Facility Usage Fee\nTo offset the revenue loss from phasing out the tax on non-profit performing arts organizations, the non-resident\nsports facility usage fee was established in 2005. Total non-resident sports facility usage fee revenues are\nbudgeted at $4.4 million in 2024, an estimated 99.3 percent increase over the prior year. The fee is 3 percent of\nthe earned income generated by non-residents using a publicly funded facility to engage in an athletic event or\nperformance. This results in a conservative forecast with growth slightly above the consumer price index. Total\nnon-resident sports facility usage fee revenues are forecast to increase by 2.3 percent each year through 2028.\nTelecommunication Licensing Fee\nThe telecommunication licensing fee is budgeted at $1.2 million in 2024, a 26.5 percent decrease compared with\nthe prior year. The fee is levied on telecommunications companies for the privilege of running lines under public\nstreets, bridges and sidewalks. Total telecommunication licensing fee collections are forecast to increase by 1.0\npercent each year through 2028.\nInstitution and Service Privilege Tax\nThe institution and service privilege tax is budgeted at $460,644 in 2024, an estimated 16.8 percent decrease\nover the prior year. The tax is levied on the gross income of foundations, partnerships and non-profit organizations\nthat provide a public service. Total revenues are forecast to increase by 2.7 percent each year through 2028,\nroughly in line with inflation.\nNon-Profit Payments for Services\nNon-profit payments for services are contractual payments from the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh for\nsome of their properties that have been taken off the tax rolls. The total budget for this line item is $438,891 in\n2024.\nOutdoor Advertising Excise Tax\nCity Council enacted an outdoor advertising excise tax in 2013. This tax on billboards was estimated to bring in\n$1.2 to $2.0 million dollars annually to the City. This tax is currently in litigation; no tax revenue has been collected\nby the City.\nNon-Tax Revenues\nNon-tax revenues are divided into six categories: licenses and permits, charges for service, fines and forfeitures,\nintergovernmental revenue, interest earnings, and miscellaneous revenues. Non-tax revenues are forecast to\nincrease by 6.9 percent in 2024 over the prior year and decrease by 6.1 percent each year through 2028.\nLicenses and Permits\nTotal revenues for the licenses and permits category are budgeted at $17.1 million in 2024, an estimated 7.2\npercent increase over the prior year. Licenses account for 5.0 percent of this revenue and permits account for\n94.7 percent 2024. Licenses are issued to businesses and vendors for a variety of purposes (e.g., poker\nmachines, parking lots, and pool tables). The largest source of license revenue is liquor and malt beverage\n42\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Revenue\nlicenses, budgeted at $394 thousand in 2024 and increasing by 2.2 percent per year thereafter. Permits are\ngenerally issued for building construction and renovation. The largest source of permit revenues are commercial\nbuilding permits, budgeted at $5.5 million in 2024. Total license and permit revenues are forecast to increase by\n4.5 percent each year through 2028.\nChapter 170 of the City Code requires City Council to annually authorize a fee schedule for all licenses and\npermits. The master fee schedule is a separate piece of legislation from the appropriations and salaries\nresolutions contained in this budget document.\nCharges for Service\nTotal revenues for the charges for service category are budgeted at $41.2 million in 2024, an estimated 6.9\npercent increase over the prior year. The City of Pittsburgh charges various entities to recoup costs for services\nprovided throughout the year. The largest source of revenue in the category is medical service revenues,\nbudgeted at $16.6 million in 2024 and forecast to increase by 2.1 percent each year thereafter. Other large\nrevenues in the category include: daily parking meters, budgeted at $10.5 million in 2024; indirect costs provided\nto PWSA, budgeted at $1.2 million; and cable bureau revenues, budgeted at $4.2 million. Total charges for\nservice revenues are forecast to increase by 1.7 percent each year through 2028.\nFines and Forfeitures\nTotal revenues for the fines and forfeitures category are budgeted at $8.7 million in 2024, an estimated 0.5\npercent increase over the prior year.

The 2 percent share of local slots revenue is budgeted at\n$10.0 million per year through 2028 and the liquid fuels tax transfer is budgeted at $4.1 million per year. Total\nintergovernmental revenues are forecast to increase by 1.2 percent each year through 2028.\nInterest Earnings and Miscellaneous Revenues\nTotal revenues from interest earnings are budgeted at $16.5 million in 2024, an estimated 146.7 percent increase\nfrom the prior year.

The five largest divisions in fiscal year 2024, with respect to\ntotal appropriated budget, are: Department of Finance, Bureau of Police, Bureau of Fire, Department of Human\nResources and Civil Service, and the Bureau of Emergency Medical Services. In total, these departments account\nfor 70.4 percent of total expenditures in the 2024 Operating Budget.

Personnel related\nexpenditures include salaries and employee benefits including healthcare, workers’ compensation benefits,\npension benefits, and retiree benefits. In total these expenditures account for $502,900,326 or 73.5 percent of\ntotal expenditures budgeted in fiscal year 2024.\n2024 Personnel vs. Non-Personnel\nExpenditures\nNon-Personnel: $181,652,712\nPersonnel: $502,900,326\nThe subclass breakdown of total budget expenditures illustrates the proportion of the budget that is dedicated to\npersonnel-related expenditures, professional and technical services, property services, other services, supplies,\nproperty, miscellaneous expenses, and debt service. Of the $181,652,712 budget in non-personnel related\nexpenditures in fiscal year 2024, $69,390,272 or 38.2 percent is dedicated to repaying the principal and interest\ncosts of issued bonds.

The City plans to achieve these by:\n• Eliminating operating deficits in the baseline financial projections while preserving core municipal services\n• Managing the City’s debt burden to provide more resources to support daily operations\n• Keeping the City’s fund balance at an appropriate level to avoid the need for cash flow borrowings and\nprovide an adequate buffer against unanticipated revenue shortfalls or expenditure increases\n• Maintaining the City’s pension fund contributions at levels recommended by its actuary\nThe 2024 Operating Budget and Five-Year Plan provides a fiscally responsible path to address legacy costs and\nimprove the City’s long-term fiscal health by:\n• Allocating an additional $243 million to the pension fund over five years beyond the state mandated\nminimum municipal obligation (MMO) to reach the actuarial recommended contribution (ARC)\n• Continuing efforts of responsible borrowing with the City’s debt burden totaling 10.1 percent of General\nFund expenditures in 2024\n• Allocating a $22.0 million in \"pay-as-you-go\" (PAYGO) transfer to the capital improvement plan\nIn addition to the information outlined in the revenue and expenditure sections of the budget document, key\ncomponents and assumptions incorporated into the forecast include the following:\n• Salaries & Wages: OMB will continue to work with departments to identify opportunities to increase\nworkplace productivity and implement other operational efficiencies as part of the enterprise cost\nmanagement initiative.\n• Employee Benefits: This category includes all health care costs for both active and retired employees,\nworkers' compensation costs, employer mandated costs such as social security, and employer\ncontributions to the pension fund. Health care costs are projected to rise over the course of the next few\nyears, but the City is working to improve its overall wellness program with the goal of improving employee\n53\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget\nFiscal Year 2024 Expenditures\nhealth and managing costs. Pension projections incorporate initiatives related to increased pension\nfunding and the 2018 increase in the parking tax commitment.\n• Other Non-Personnel Operating Costs: Projections for this category incorporate contractually required\ncosts that are known at this time, analyses of historical spending, and the reallocation of budgets across\neach department.\n• Debt Service: The forecast assumes that with the significant reduction in debt service that occurred in\n2019, the City will be able to responsibly issue bonds each year to address the City’s critical infrastructure\nneeds.\n• PAYGO: The City funds a number of capital projects through a transfer from the General Fund into the\nCapital Projects Fund each year. PAYGO (or “pay-as-you-go”) transfers are funds that the City spends on\ncapital projects that may not be eligible for bond or Community Development funds. In the 2024 Capital\nImprovement Plan, projects funded with PAYGO are mainly focused on neighborhood improvement,\neconomic development, and blight remediation. The forecast assumes that the City will continue to\ncontribute PAYGO funds for capital projects consistent with Chapter 218 of the City Code, contributing\n$22 million in 2024 and a total of $21.1 million from 2025 to 2028.\nMost non-personnel related subclasses are projected to remain relatively flat or increase modestly throughout\nfiscal year 2028.

Through partnerships and program development,\nthe Office will focus on:\nDeveloping a Continuum of Support: Through continued collaboration with first responders and community\nmembers, analysis of calls for service, mapping of existing services, development of new partnerships, and\nevaluation of existing models, the Office of Community Health & Safety (OCH&S) will establish a continuum of\nresources and responders to address community unmet social service needs that are often encountered by Public\nSafety partners. First responder social support referrals, case conferencing and review, and service gap analysis\nwill be utilized to build this continuum.\nImplementation of Public Health-Informed Practices: Public Safety personnel consistently respond to\ncommunity needs that exceed what they can provide in a single engagement model; however, first responders\nhave significant exposure to issues that affect community members’ health and well-being. OCH&S will work with\nthe Department of Public Safety, public health entities, and academic partners to evaluate new programs and\nresponses to proactively address issues (especially upstream interventions) and reduce harm experienced by\ncommunity members. Additionally, partners will evaluate best practices, facilitate focus groups, and elevate\ntranslational experiences.\nConsistent Community Engagement and Partnership: Continued community engagement, transparency, and\naccountability to the community and first responders is critical to building trust and facilitating change in the\ncurrent response continuum. OCH&S will create a collaborative model of program development and evaluation,\nprioritizing continuous review to ensure that deficits are quickly addressed and used for growth. OCH&S will\npartner with existing community organizations and prioritize community members who have been harmed and\nmay not engage in traditional meetings. Initial efforts will focus on creation of multiple advisory collaboratives\nfocused on Black neighborhoods most harmed by the war on drugs and systemic racism.\nNote: The Office of Community Health full time positions can be found in the Stop the Violence trust fund.\n196\nCity of Pittsburgh Operating Budget Office of Community Health and Safety\nFiscal Year 2024 102300\n2023 Accomplishments\n• Launch of Co-Response in 2023 in Police Zones 1 & 2, which includes Downtown Pittsburgh.

To accomplish this assignment, the Board\nwill thoroughly investigate specific allegations of misconduct, hold public hearings to examine such allegations;\nevaluate current police procedures and promote safe, professional and effective law enforcement practices\nthrough public education on rights, responsibilities and police authority; and make recommendations to the Mayor\nand Chief of Police regarding police policies and procedures.\nA Board comprised of seven members appointed by the Mayor and City Council presides over the work of the\nstaff and determines all final dispositions of cases. The Board conducts public hearings and renders findings and\nrecommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor as related to the matter or complaint under review.\nDepartmental/Bureau Overview\nInvestigation and Complaint Disposition - Citizens must file a notice of intent to file a citizen complaint with the\nCPRB within six months of the incident from which the complaint arises. Upon contact from a citizen, the Intake\nCoordinator evaluates the complaint for administrative compliance and initiates the internal case management of\nthe complaint. The Intake Coordinator informs the complainant of his/her rights and responsibilities related to the\ncomplaint. The Executive Director or the Assistant Executive Director reviews each citizen complaint, develops a\npreliminary investigative plan and assigns the case to an Investigator. The Assistant Executive Director provides\ndaily supervision and oversight of case investigations. Investigators conduct preliminary inquiries into cases and\nthe results are presented to the Board. The Board considers the evidence and determines whether to further an\ninvestigation into the allegations of misconduct or to dismiss the complaint. Complaints may proceed through\ninvestigation to a public hearing at the Board’s discretion. Findings and recommendations resulting from public\nhearings are forwarded to the Mayor and Chief of Police who must respond to the Board. Patterns emerging from\ncomplaints and allegations of misconduct may be presented to the Board for consideration of policy\nrecommendations to the Chief of Police and Mayor.\nCommunity Education - The goal of community education and outreach is to improve relations between citizens\nand police by developing or enhancing common knowledge of police authority, practices and procedures, and\ncivilian expectations of police conduct. Outreach utilizes printed material, traditional and social media, and\npersonal appearances of members and staff to ensure the public has an opportunity to be informed of the CPRB’s\nrole and common rights and responsibilities of citizenship. The effort directed to citizens (1) ensures that the\npublic is adequately prepared to respond to police encounters in a manner conducive to the safety of the citizen\nand the officer, and (2) conveys information on filing complaints when such encounters are perceived as\noffensive. The outreach to police officers is designed to encourage participation in investigations, explain the\nprocess, and integrate their concerns into the community education effort.\nBoard and Staff Development - Training for Members encompasses topics mandated by City Ordinance,\nincluding police training, police policies and procedures, criminal, civil and constitutional law as well as human\nrights and contemporary practices of civilian review of law enforcement policies and police behavior. Staff training\nis designed to enhance investigative skills, utilize technology for research and case management, and develops\nmediation and conciliation skills as well as crisis management and safety skills. Staff adheres to the standards\nand performance objectives expected of Certified Police Oversight Professionals.\nAdministrative - The Executive Director is responsible for administering the policies and procedures of the Board\nand those of the City which affect the daily operation of the Independent Citizen Police Review Board. Activities\nof this core service include the planning, organization, development, evaluation, and implementation of efficient\nand effective management strategies of fiscal, personnel, information systems, and related support to maximize\nthe utility of the resources available.

The aim is to increase grant-related revenue, limit the City’s exposure to any grant-related legal liability,\nand improve the efficiency and impact of programs and services funded through grant dollars.\nThe Grants Office helps departments find and apply for grant opportunities, thereby allowing each department to\nexpand its overall capacity without placing greater burden on the City’s Operating and Capital budgets. Grant\nfunds received by the City of Pittsburgh support important programs and services that the City provides to our\ncommunity. These funds allow the City to extend pre-existing services, introduce new initiatives, gain\ntechnological advances, and subsidize programmatic staffing and equipment. Grant funds are dispersed\nthroughout the City and impact a variety of efforts, including public safety, economic development, social services,\nrecreation, and infrastructure improvement and maintenance, among many others. Because grant funding allows\nthe City to leverage local public funds in order to extend and enhance the services it offers to the community, the\nimpact of grant funding upon the City of Pittsburgh is significant.\nIn 2023, the City of Pittsburgh was awarded 31 new awards for a total of $31,823,429 in funding. Some projects\nsupported by this funding include the Reconnecting Communities grant for improvements in Manchester, funding\nto rehabilitate a downtown park, and safety improvements at the intersection of Liberty Avenue and the Bloomfield\nBridge supported by a State grant award..\nNew Grants by Department, Office, or Bureau\n7.2%\n18.9%\n4.9%\n4.4% DPW\nBudget\n0.3% Innovation and Performance\nPlanning\n0.3% Mayor's Office\nPolice\n0.8% Fire\nOCHS\nPublic Safety -
