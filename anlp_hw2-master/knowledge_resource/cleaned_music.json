BENEDUM CENTERMAR 22-30 Pittsburgh Opera enriches Pittsburgh and the tri-state area and draws national and international attention to the region by: The current leader of Pittsburgh Opera is Christopher Hahn, who became Artistic Director in 2000 and General Director in 2008. During his tenure he has considerably expanded the companys repertoire to include Baroque and many contemporary works, and he has vigorously upheld Pittsburgh Operas high standards of management and artistic excellence. He has expanded the Resident Artist Program to include two annual productions, both of which are offered as part of the full subscription series. He led the move to Bitz Opera Factory in the historic George Westinghouse Air Brake Factory at 2425 Liberty Avenue, in Pittsburghs Strip District, and developed a range of audience and community programs that take place there. Pittsburgh Opera's current Music Director, Antony Walker, was appointed in 2005 and has brought an engaged and highly informed leadership to the companys musical forces as well as developing a music staff of note. Download the Pittsburgh Opera Fact Sheet here. Founded in 1939 by five intrepid women who belonged to Pittsburghs Tuesday Musical Club (pianist Virginia C. Byerly; contralto Carolyn Hunt Mahaffey; Priscilla W. Collins; Ruby N. Wickersham; and Marie M. Pease), these Founding Five established The Pittsburgh Opera Society, which would become the seventh-oldest opera company in the United States. The first production, in March 1940 at Carnegie Music Hall, was The Tales of Hoffmann, with Mahaffey as Nicklausse. The companys first conductor, Richard Karp of Vienna, led Pittsburgh Opera for nearly 40 years and oversaw the companys move to Heinz Hall in 1971. In 1983, Tito Capobianco, a stage director and prominent figure at New York City Opera, became Pittsburgh Operas General Director. Capobianco molded the Opera into an influential national company and a steward of cultural life in Pittsburgh. Under his direction, the Opera established its own orchestra, pioneered the use of supertitles, formed the Resident Artists Program and dramatically increased the region's audience for opera. Mark Weinsteins appointment as General Director in 1997 marked another milestone in the companys growth. Weinstein, pursued rigorous financial management and long-range strategic planning. He increased the companys assets threefold and cemented the Operas reputation as a leader in financial management in the region. Weinstein initiated the Artistic Excellence Project, and raised major funds which led to the appointment of Christopher Hahn as Artistic Director in 2000 and John Mauceri as Music Director in 2001. In 2008 Pittsburgh Opera moved to its current and permanent home in the Strip District, finally achieving the space to house the resources needed to better prepare for performances at the Benedum, while opening new ways for the community to experience all the artistry that is part of opera. In an effort to maintain the Companys mission to enrich Pittsburgh and the tri-state area, the Opera has committed to the use of sustainable methods in the renovation and maintenance of the Bitz Opera Factory, obtaining a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Operations and Maintenance Silver Certification in June 2011. In addition to its mainstage productions, Pittsburgh Opera produces a range of programs to engage and enrich the community, with more than 15,000 students, families and educators participating in its educational events annually. The internationally-renowned Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist Program is among the countrys top five training centers for rising opera stars and the newly designed administrative and rehearsal space provides for events ranging from free community Song Shop Concerts to concert recitals by world-class opera singers. Pittsburgh Operas long-standing commitment to artistic excellence, responsible fiscal management and good neighborship will continue to prove a valuable asset to the city of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region for years to come. 2425 LIBERTY AVE.PITTSBURGH, PA 15222 P. 412-281-0912 2025 PITTSBURGH OPERA Table 1: Div 2: GIVE NOWLOGINCALENDARThis is a search field with an auto-suggest

international attention to the region by:Creating live opera at the highest standards of artistic excellenceMaking opera accessible to a diverse audienceDeveloping young singers into tomorrows artistsEnsuring the future through responsible fiscal managementThe current leader of Pittsburgh Opera isChristopher Hahn, who became Artistic Director in 2000 and General Director in 2008. During his tenure he has considerably expanded the companys repertoire to include Baroque and many contemporary works, and he has vigorously upheld Pittsburgh Operas high standards of management and artistic excellence. He has expanded theResident Artist Programto include two annual productions, both of which are offered as part of the full subscription series. He led the move toBitz Opera Factoryin the historic George Westinghouse Air Brake Factory at 2425 Liberty Avenue, in Pittsburghs Strip District, and developed a range of audience and community programs that take place there.Pittsburgh Opera's current Music Director,Antony Walker, was appointed in 2005 and has brought an engaged and highly informed leadership to the companys musical forces as well as developing a music staff of note.Download the Pittsburgh Opera Fact Sheet here.Our BeginningsFounded in 1939 by five intrepid women who belonged to Pittsburghs Tuesday Musical Club (pianistVirginia C. Byerly; contraltoCarolyn Hunt Mahaffey;Priscilla W. Collins;Ruby N. Wickersham; andMarie M. Pease), these Founding Five established The Pittsburgh Opera Society, which would become the seventh-oldest opera company in the United States.The first production, in March 1940 at Carnegie Music Hall, wasThe Tales of Hoffmann, with Mahaffey as Nicklausse. The companys first conductor,Richard Karpof Vienna, led Pittsburgh Opera for nearly 40 years and oversaw the companys move to Heinz Hall in 1971.In 1983,Tito Capobianco, a stage director and prominent figure at New York City Opera, became Pittsburgh Operas General Director. Capobianco molded the Opera into an influential national company and a steward of cultural life in Pittsburgh. Under his direction, the Opera established its own orchestra, pioneered the use of supertitles, formed the Resident Artists Program and dramatically increased the region's audience for opera.Mark Weinsteins appointment as General Director in 1997 marked another milestone in the companys growth. Weinstein, pursued rigorous financial management and long-range strategic planning. He increased the companys assets threefold and cemented the Operas reputation as a leader in financial management in the region.Weinstein initiated the Artistic Excellence Project, and raised major funds which led to the appointment of Christopher Hahn as Artistic Director in 2000 andJohn Maucerias Music Director in 2001.Our New HomeIn 2008 Pittsburgh Opera moved to its current andpermanent home in the Strip District, finally achieving the space to house the resources needed to better prepare for performances at the Benedum, while opening new ways for the community to experience all the artistry that is part of opera. In an effort to maintain the Companys mission to enrich Pittsburgh and the tri-state area, the Opera has committed to the use of sustainable methods in the renovation and maintenance of the Bitz Opera Factory, obtaining a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Operations and Maintenance Silver Certification in June 2011.In addition to its mainstage productions, Pittsburgh Opera produces a range of programs to engage and enrich the community, with more than 15,000 students, families and educators participating in itseducational eventsannually.

    "https://trustarts.org/pct_home/about": "Performing Arts. Visual Arts. Festivals. Arts Education. Urban Development. Since 1984, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, a non-profit arts organization, has worked to make the Steel City a place where the arts can flourish. Our efforts have focused on the cultural and economic development of the Cultural District, a 14-square-block area of downtown Pittsburgh. What was once a downtrodden red light district now thrives as a vibrant center for culture, art, food, and community. Pittsburghs Cultural District stands as a nationwide model for how the arts can play a pivotal role in urban revitalization. Each year, millions of people visit the Cultural District to expand their horizons in our theaters, galleries, and public art environments. Patrons enjoy thousands of world-class performing arts events and visual arts exhibitions. Pittsburgh residents of all ages connect and learn with the Trusts comprehensive education and community engagement opportunities. Local arts organizations collaborate to build a stronger cultural community through the power of partnerships. The Cultural District acts as the anchor for all of that work. The Trusts superior venues and gallery spaces allow resident companies, community organizations, artists, and promoters to reach audiences large and small. In total, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust manages more than one million square feet of real estate in the District. Step outside those buildings to find numerous public art installations that beautify Pittsburgh's largest arts neighborhood. Lauded as the single greatest creative force in Pittsburgh because of its spirit of reinvention by the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, the Trust strives every day to enrich the city of Pittsburghs vibrancy, diversity, and prosperity.",
