Two kids discover a bank note frozen in a block of ice, which they hope to retrieve to buy their classmates a new pair of glasses. A tour guide brings befuddled visitors on a walking tour of the city’s modest environs. A melancholy man (Rankin, in an autobiographical role) returns home from Montreal to reunite with his family after many years. Imagining a city in which Farsi is the predominant language, Rankin’s visually and narratively inventive film was inspired by Iranian films of the 1970s, frequently humanistic children’s fables, in this case transferred to a world of beige, concrete brutalist buildings and increasingly surreal, Tati-esque humor.\nDirected by Matthew Rankin\n2024 | Canada | Farsi and French language with English subtitles | DCP\n----------------------------------------\nDate: 2025-03-20\nEvent Page URL: https://downtownpittsburgh.com/events/event/?id=62398\nDetails:\nARTS + CULTURE, ENTERTAINMENT, FILM & MOVIES\nVermiglio\nMar 7, 2025 - Mar 20, 2025\nHarris Theater\n809 Liberty Ave\nPittsburgh, PA 15222\nEVENT WEBSITE\nThe lush and breathtaking beauty of the Alps, filmed with painterly grace under natural light from frigid winter to redemptive spring, provides the physical and emotional backdrop for ‘Vermiglio,’ Maura Delpero’s visionary film, which won the Silver Lion at the 2024 Venice Film Festival. This singular portrait of a sprawling family, set in the small, mountainous village of Vermiglio during the waning days of WWII, follows a series of dramatic, consequential events after the arrival of a taciturn Sicilian soldier (Giuseppe De Domenico), who hides out in town after deserting the army. While there, the soldier develops a romance with the family's eldest daughter, Lucia (Martina Scrinzi). ‘Vermiglio’ shows the lives of a provincial family in a remote village suspended in time by the customs of a fading era. Conjuring stories from her own family’s past, Delpero creates a deeply personal and human tale that recalls the great neorealist movement in Italian cinema, but through Lucia’s perspective ‘Vermiglio’ feels distinct and novel.

TROUBLE IN MIND is a cutting backstage satire, a play within a play, and a case of life imitating art as playwright Alice Childress refused to let producers define her story. This visionary production should have premiered on Broadway in 1955, but didn't get its due until 2021, 66 years after its intended debut. Now, TROUBLE IN MIND comes to Pittsburgh for the first time, in a premiere destined to enthrall us all.\nThis show is rated PG-13. Set in 1957, it addresses themes of racism, sexism, identity, and class, and contains strong profanity and racially offensive terms.

The High Kings formed in June 2007 when Brian, Darren, Finbarr and former member Martin Furey were asked to join a brand new Irish ballad group by David Kavanagh after he had noticed a gap in the market for a band specialising in traditional Irish music.\nIt didn’t take long during there first studio rehearsal for them to realise that the way their individual voices blended together, that they were onto something special. The High Kings play 13 instruments between them creating the unique sound and atmosphere that they still showcase to this day. This was confirmed when their self-titled debut album reached number 2 on the world Billboard Music chart. In March 2009 The High Kings played 5 consecutive sold out shows to a packed audience in Dublin’s Olympia Theatre.\nMary Black is delighted to be going back to the USA in 2025 for the first time in 8 years. Mary has become a dominant presence in Irish music, both at home and abroad, bringing her songs and music, to growing numbers of fans, not just in Ireland where she has been a household name for decades, but all over the world. As an award-winning solo artist with multiple chart-topping and critically acclaimed albums, Mary Black has been celebrated by a faithful public as well as fellow artists many of whom she has performed and recorded with over the years, including Emmylou Harris, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Joan Baez and Van Morrison (celebrated in her latest album ‘Duets'). Last year Mary received an Honorary Doctorate in Literature from UCD and RTÉ presented her with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the RTÉ Radio 1 Folk Awards. Mary and her legendary band will celebrate her career playing favourite songs from her extensive catalogue, songs that we’ve come to know and love over the years.\n----------------------------------------\nDate: 2025-04-03\nEvent Page URL: https://downtownpittsburgh.com/events/event/?id=62430\nDetails:\nFREE EVENT, TOURS\nVisit The Old Allegheny County Jail and Museum\nMar 3, 2025 - Mar 3, 2025 | 11:30 am - 1:00 pm\nOld Allegheny County Jail Museum\n440 Ross St\nPittsburgh, PA 15219\nEVENT WEBSITE\nOpen all year on the 1st and 3rd Mondays of the month except on Court holidays.\nVisit at your convenience between 11:30 a.m. and 1:00 p.m.\nCost: Free\nThe building and museum are handicap accessible.\nPHLF docents are on hand to tell you the story of the former Allegheny County Jail.

This singular portrait of a sprawling family, set in the small, mountainous village of Vermiglio during the waning days of WWII, follows a series of dramatic, consequential events after the arrival of a taciturn Sicilian soldier (Giuseppe De Domenico), who hides out in town after deserting the army. While there, the soldier develops a romance with the family's eldest daughter, Lucia (Martina Scrinzi). ‘Vermiglio’ shows the lives of a provincial family in a remote village suspended in time by the customs of a fading era. Conjuring stories from her own family’s past, Delpero creates a deeply personal and human tale that recalls the great neorealist movement in Italian cinema, but through Lucia’s perspective ‘Vermiglio’ feels distinct and novel.

Over these years, Liza seeks out extraordinary mentors: KayThompson, Fred Ebb, Charles Aznavour, Halston, and Bob Fosse. With insightful participation from a coterie of colleagues such as Michael Feinstein, Mia Farrow, Ben Vereen, Joel Grey and the late Chita Rivera, along with the revelatory participation by the star herself, the film illuminates the contradiction of Liza Minnelli: her privilege and struggle, strength and vulnerability, unreal expectations and towering talent–the friction of which fueled her stunning rise, resilience and her enduring place as one of thegreatest, most original performers in the history of entertainment.\nDirected by Bruce David Klein\n2024 | USA | English language | DCP\n----------------------------------------\nDate: 2025-04-07\nEvent Page URL: https://downtownpittsburgh.com/events/event/?id=62449\nDetails:\nENTERTAINMENT, MUSIC\nKraftwerk: Multimedia Tour 2025 – 50 Years of Autobahn\nMar 7, 2025 - Mar 7, 2025 | 7:00 pm - 11:00 pm\nStage AE\n400 N Shore Dr\nPittsburgh, PA 15212\nEVENT WEBSITE\n----------------------------------------\nDate: 2025-04-07\nEvent Page URL: https://downtownpittsburgh.com/events/event/?id=62456\nDetails:\nENTERTAINMENT, TOURS\nMovie Mobile: Speed\nMar 7, 2025 - Mar 7, 2025 | 7:00 pm - 10:00 pm\nThe Burgh Bus\n1027 Penn Ave\nPittsburgh, PA 15222\nEVENT WEBSITE\nComing soon to a bus near you…\n\nOur first screening event on the bus will be a special presentation of the 90s action movie classic…\n“SPEED” \n\n\nThat’s right folks, we will be showing “Speed”, on a moving bus.

This singular portrait of a sprawling family, set in the small, mountainous village of Vermiglio during the waning days of WWII, follows a series of dramatic, consequential events after the arrival of a taciturn Sicilian soldier (Giuseppe De Domenico), who hides out in town after deserting the army. While there, the soldier develops a romance with the family's eldest daughter, Lucia (Martina Scrinzi). ‘Vermiglio’ shows the lives of a provincial family in a remote village suspended in time by the customs of a fading era. Conjuring stories from her own family’s past, Delpero creates a deeply personal and human tale that recalls the great neorealist movement in Italian cinema, but through Lucia’s perspective ‘Vermiglio’ feels distinct and novel.

Over these years, Liza seeks out extraordinary mentors: KayThompson, Fred Ebb, Charles Aznavour, Halston, and Bob Fosse. With insightful participation from a coterie of colleagues such as Michael Feinstein, Mia Farrow, Ben Vereen, Joel Grey and the late Chita Rivera, along with the revelatory participation by the star herself, the film illuminates the contradiction of Liza Minnelli: her privilege and struggle, strength and vulnerability, unreal expectations and towering talent–the friction of which fueled her stunning rise, resilience and her enduring place as one of thegreatest, most original performers in the history of entertainment.\nDirected by Bruce David Klein\n2024 | USA | English language | DCP\n----------------------------------------\nDate: 2025-04-08\nEvent Page URL: https://downtownpittsburgh.com/events/event/?id=62437\nDetails:\nENTERTAINMENT, FAMILY\nDisney on Ice: Mickey’s Search Party\nMar 6, 2025 - Mar 9, 2025\nPPG Paints Arena\n1001 Fifth Ave\nPittsburgh, PA 15219\nEVENT WEBSITE\nJoin Mickey Mouse and his Disney friends on adventures filled with world-class skating, high-flying acrobatics, and unexpected stunts!\n----------------------------------------\nDate: 2025-04-08\nEvent Page URL: https://downtownpittsburgh.com/events/event/?id=62559\nDetails:\nARTS + CULTURE\nAugust Taught Us\nMar 6, 2025 - Apr 6, 2025\nBenedum Gallery, 2nd Floor\n980 Liberty Ave\nPittsburgh, PA 15222\nEVENT WEBSITE\nRenowned visual artist and cultural agitator DS Kinsel will unveil new work created as part of the August Wilson Archive Community Artist-Scholar Award program sponsored by the University of Pittsburgh Library System.\nThe exhibition titled, August Taught Us…, presents powerful artifacts created by Kinsel inspired by the life and legacy of August Wilson.

This singular portrait of a sprawling family, set in the small, mountainous village of Vermiglio during the waning days of WWII, follows a series of dramatic, consequential events after the arrival of a taciturn Sicilian soldier (Giuseppe De Domenico), who hides out in town after deserting the army. While there, the soldier develops a romance with the family's eldest daughter, Lucia (Martina Scrinzi). ‘Vermiglio’ shows the lives of a provincial family in a remote village suspended in time by the customs of a fading era. Conjuring stories from her own family’s past, Delpero creates a deeply personal and human tale that recalls the great neorealist movement in Italian cinema, but through Lucia’s perspective ‘Vermiglio’ feels distinct and novel.

With insightful participation from a coterie of colleagues such as Michael Feinstein, Mia Farrow, Ben Vereen, Joel Grey and the late Chita Rivera, along with the revelatory participation by the star herself, the film illuminates the contradiction of Liza Minnelli: her privilege and struggle, strength and vulnerability, unreal expectations and towering talent–the friction of which fueled her stunning rise, resilience and her enduring place as one of thegreatest, most original performers in the history of entertainment.\nDirected by Bruce David Klein\n2024 | USA | English language | DCP\n----------------------------------------\nDate: 2025-04-09\nEvent Page URL: https://downtownpittsburgh.com/events/event/?id=62437\nDetails:\nENTERTAINMENT, FAMILY\nDisney on Ice: Mickey’s Search Party\nMar 6, 2025 - Mar 9, 2025\nPPG Paints Arena\n1001 Fifth Ave\nPittsburgh, PA 15219\nEVENT WEBSITE\nJoin Mickey Mouse and his Disney friends on adventures filled with world-class skating, high-flying acrobatics, and unexpected stunts!\n----------------------------------------\nDate: 2025-04-09\nEvent Page URL: https://downtownpittsburgh.com/events/event/?id=62559\nDetails:\nARTS + CULTURE\nAugust Taught Us\nMar 6, 2025 - Apr 6, 2025\nBenedum Gallery, 2nd Floor\n980 Liberty Ave\nPittsburgh, PA 15222\nEVENT WEBSITE\nRenowned visual artist and cultural agitator DS Kinsel will unveil new work created as part of the August Wilson Archive Community Artist-Scholar Award program sponsored by the University of Pittsburgh Library System.\nThe exhibition titled, August Taught Us…, presents powerful artifacts created by Kinsel inspired by the life and legacy of August Wilson.

This singular portrait of a sprawling family, set in the small, mountainous village of Vermiglio during the waning days of WWII, follows a series of dramatic, consequential events after the arrival of a taciturn Sicilian soldier (Giuseppe De Domenico), who hides out in town after deserting the army. While there, the soldier develops a romance with the family's eldest daughter, Lucia (Martina Scrinzi). ‘Vermiglio’ shows the lives of a provincial family in a remote village suspended in time by the customs of a fading era. Conjuring stories from her own family’s past, Delpero creates a deeply personal and human tale that recalls the great neorealist movement in Italian cinema, but through Lucia’s perspective ‘Vermiglio’ feels distinct and novel.

Over these years, Liza seeks out extraordinary mentors: KayThompson, Fred Ebb, Charles Aznavour, Halston, and Bob Fosse. With insightful participation from a coterie of colleagues such as Michael Feinstein, Mia Farrow, Ben Vereen, Joel Grey and the late Chita Rivera, along with the revelatory participation by the star herself, the film illuminates the contradiction of Liza Minnelli: her privilege and struggle, strength and vulnerability, unreal expectations and towering talent–the friction of which fueled her stunning rise, resilience and her enduring place as one of thegreatest, most original performers in the history of entertainment.\nDirected by Bruce David Klein\n2024 | USA | English language | DCP\n----------------------------------------\nDate: 2025-04-12\nEvent Page URL: https://downtownpittsburgh.com/events/event/?id=62559\nDetails:\nARTS + CULTURE\nAugust Taught Us\nMar 6, 2025 - Apr 6, 2025\nBenedum Gallery, 2nd Floor\n980 Liberty Ave\nPittsburgh, PA 15222\nEVENT WEBSITE\nRenowned visual artist and cultural agitator DS Kinsel will unveil new work created as part of the August Wilson Archive Community Artist-Scholar Award program sponsored by the University of Pittsburgh Library System.\nThe exhibition titled, August Taught Us…, presents powerful artifacts created by Kinsel inspired by the life and legacy of August Wilson.

Two kids discover a bank note frozen in a block of ice, which they hope to retrieve to buy their classmates a new pair of glasses. A tour guide brings befuddled visitors on a walking tour of the city’s modest environs. A melancholy man (Rankin, in an autobiographical role) returns home from Montreal to reunite with his family after many years. Imagining a city in which Farsi is the predominant language, Rankin’s visually and narratively inventive film was inspired by Iranian films of the 1970s, frequently humanistic children’s fables, in this case transferred to a world of beige, concrete brutalist buildings and increasingly surreal, Tati-esque humor.\nDirected by Matthew Rankin\n2024 | Canada | Farsi and French language with English subtitles | DCP\n----------------------------------------\nDate: 2025-04-14\nEvent Page URL: https://downtownpittsburgh.com/events/event/?id=62453\nDetails:\nARTS + CULTURE, ENTERTAINMENT\nSound in Motion\nMar 14, 2025 - Mar 16, 2025\nNew Hazlett Theater\n6 Allegheny Square East\nPittsburgh, PA 15212\nEVENT WEBSITE\nTexture Contemporary Ballet’s 14th season culminates in Sound in Motion, a captivating exploration of the interplay between movement and music.

This singular portrait of a sprawling family, set in the small, mountainous village of Vermiglio during the waning days of WWII, follows a series of dramatic, consequential events after the arrival of a taciturn Sicilian soldier (Giuseppe De Domenico), who hides out in town after deserting the army. While there, the soldier develops a romance with the family's eldest daughter, Lucia (Martina Scrinzi). ‘Vermiglio’ shows the lives of a provincial family in a remote village suspended in time by the customs of a fading era. Conjuring stories from her own family’s past, Delpero creates a deeply personal and human tale that recalls the great neorealist movement in Italian cinema, but through Lucia’s perspective ‘Vermiglio’ feels distinct and novel.

This singular portrait of a sprawling family, set in the small, mountainous village of Vermiglio during the waning days of WWII, follows a series of dramatic, consequential events after the arrival of a taciturn Sicilian soldier (Giuseppe De Domenico), who hides out in town after deserting the army. While there, the soldier develops a romance with the family's eldest daughter, Lucia (Martina Scrinzi). ‘Vermiglio’ shows the lives of a provincial family in a remote village suspended in time by the customs of a fading era. Conjuring stories from her own family’s past, Delpero creates a deeply personal and human tale that recalls the great neorealist movement in Italian cinema, but through Lucia’s perspective ‘Vermiglio’ feels distinct and novel.

This singular portrait of a sprawling family, set in the small, mountainous village of Vermiglio during the waning days of WWII, follows a series of dramatic, consequential events after the arrival of a taciturn Sicilian soldier (Giuseppe De Domenico), who hides out in town after deserting the army. While there, the soldier develops a romance with the family's eldest daughter, Lucia (Martina Scrinzi). ‘Vermiglio’ shows the lives of a provincial family in a remote village suspended in time by the customs of a fading era. Conjuring stories from her own family’s past, Delpero creates a deeply personal and human tale that recalls the great neorealist movement in Italian cinema, but through Lucia’s perspective ‘Vermiglio’ feels distinct and novel.

Now, TROUBLE IN MIND comes to Pittsburgh for the first time, in a premiere destined to enthrall us all.\nThis show is rated PG-13. Set in 1957, it addresses themes of racism, sexism, identity, and class, and contains strong profanity and racially offensive terms. This production contains the use of haze.\n----------------------------------------\nDate: 2025-04-23\nEvent Page URL: https://downtownpittsburgh.com/events/event/?id=62181\nDetails:\nCOMMUNITY, FAMILY\nFlamingo Fest\nFeb 22, 2025 - Feb 23, 2025 | 11:00 am - 3:00 pm\nNational Aviary\n700 Arch St\nPittsburgh, PA 15212\nEVENT WEBSITE\nGet ready to fla-mingle!
