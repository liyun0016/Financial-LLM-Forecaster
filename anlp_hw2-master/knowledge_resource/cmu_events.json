However, satellite congestion, space debris, and threats like energy weapons and anti-satellite missiles pose a significant risk. DeNardis will discuss the governance considerations needed as we work towards building a secure solar-system Internet, including the security implications of shifting stakeholders from nation-states to private entities.\nLaura DeNardis is professor and endowed chair in technology, ethics and society at Georgetown University. A scholar of cybersecurity and technology governance, DeNardis was listed as one of thirty-two Innovators Building a Better Future by Wired UK. Among her many books, The Internet in Everything: Freedom and Security in a World with No Off Switch was listed as a Financial Times Top Technology Book of 2020 and her book The Global War for Internet Governance is considered a definitive source for understanding conflicts in cyberspace. DeNardis is an affiliated fellow of the Yale Information Society Project, where she previously served as executive director. She served as the research director of the Global Commission on Internet Governance from 2014 to 2016. She holds an engineering science degree from Dartmouth, an MS in engineering from Cornell, a PhD in science and technology studies from Virginia Tech, and was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship from Yale Law School.\nRegister for the event\n----------------------------------------\nDate: 20250327\nDay View Title: Ballpark Foods\nEvent Title: Ballpark Foods\nDetail URL: https://events.cmu.edu/event/13727-ballpark-foods\nDetails:\nCelebrate MLB opening night in style with some delicious ballpark themed foods!\n----------------------------------------\nDate: 20250327\nDay View Title: Ingrid Mayrhofer-Hufnagl Lecture: AI ⊂ IA: Machines and Intelligent Artifacts\nEvent Title: Ingrid Mayrhofer-Hufnagl Lecture: AI ⊂ IA: Machines and Intelligent Artifacts\nDetail URL: https://events.cmu.edu/event/13709-ingrid-mayrhofer-hufnagl-lecture-ai-ia-machines-and-in\nDetails:\nIngrid Mayrhofer-Hufnagl is the founder and director of A[I]rchitectural Minds (AIM), a multidisciplinary practice that merges art, science and technology.

She did everything right, but now finds herself in an unfulfilling marriage to Tyler; her unemployed, video-game-addicted, stoner husband. Her now monotonous days consist of going to work, coming home and watching commercials. The only thing she has left is her manifestations of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who try to teach her how to be the perfect woman through consumerism, sexual objectification and medication, in hopes that Grace’s pursuit of perfection will satisfy her and quell the emptiness of her life.\nHowever, Grace’s relationship with her metaphysical celebrity companions takes a bizarre turn when Mary-Kate falls in love with her, and the two go on a quest to New Zealand. Tyler, now alone, is compelled to enter his Call of Duty: Modern Warfare game to face his failures and find his purpose in his wife’s absence. Mary Kate Olsen Is in Love is a dark comedy that follows Grace on her journey to figure out what she actually wants out of her life in a world determined to tell her what will make her “happy.”\nBy Mallery Avidon\nDirected by Anya Hilpert\nPerformances April 23-25\nTickets are free and can be reserved online beginning at noon the day before each performance.\nReserve Tickets\nContent & Sensory Advisories\n----------------------------------------\nDate: 20250423\nDay View Title: CMU Drama Presents: Titanic, the Musical\nEvent Title: CMU Drama Presents: Titanic, the Musical\nDetail URL: https://events.cmu.edu/event/12776-cmu-drama-presents-titanic-the-musical\nDetails:\nEpic and majestic, with moments of heartbreaking intimacy, Titanic captures the triumph and tragedy of the hopeful passengers on the ill-fated Ship of Dreams.

She did everything right, but now finds herself in an unfulfilling marriage to Tyler; her unemployed, video-game-addicted, stoner husband. Her now monotonous days consist of going to work, coming home and watching commercials. The only thing she has left is her manifestations of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who try to teach her how to be the perfect woman through consumerism, sexual objectification and medication, in hopes that Grace’s pursuit of perfection will satisfy her and quell the emptiness of her life.\nHowever, Grace’s relationship with her metaphysical celebrity companions takes a bizarre turn when Mary-Kate falls in love with her, and the two go on a quest to New Zealand. Tyler, now alone, is compelled to enter his Call of Duty: Modern Warfare game to face his failures and find his purpose in his wife’s absence. Mary Kate Olsen Is in Love is a dark comedy that follows Grace on her journey to figure out what she actually wants out of her life in a world determined to tell her what will make her “happy.”\nBy Mallery Avidon\nDirected by Anya Hilpert\nPerformances April 23-25\nTickets are free and can be reserved online beginning at noon the day before each performance.\nReserve Tickets\nContent & Sensory Advisories\n----------------------------------------\nDate: 20250424\nDay View Title: Here to Stay: Celebrating 40 Years at the Architecture Archives\nEvent Title: Here to Stay: Celebrating 40 Years at the Architecture Archives\nDetail URL: https://events.cmu.edu/event/7307-here-to-stay-celebrating-40-years-at-the\nDetails:\nSettlement, industrialization, urbanization and redevelopment have each left a profound mark on the region’s built environment.
