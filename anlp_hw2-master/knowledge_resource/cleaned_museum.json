    "https://carnegiemuseums.org/about-us/our-history/": "The history of Carnegie Museums is bookended by two periods of fantastic growth and diversification. It all started in November of 1895 with the founding of Carnegie Institute, known today as Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. Andrew Carnegie called the original Oakland buildingwhich included Carnegie Library of Pittsburghhis monument, and he considered it the chief satisfaction of his life. Thats saying a lot, considering that this son of a poor Scottish weaver grew up to become one of the worlds most successful entrepreneurs and philanthropists. A year later, Carnegie Museums held the first Carnegie International, second only to the Venice Biennale as the worlds oldest and most prestigious international exhibition of contemporary art, and the museums collection of art quickly grew as a result. Two years later, in response to news that the bones of colossal prehistoric creatures were being found out west, Carnegie sent a scientific crew to Wyoming, where they would discover the first of many world-famous dinosaurs. A historic photo of a group of people at the 1896 Carnegie International The first Carnegie International, 1896 To make room for the display of his namesake, Diplodocus carnegii, Andrew Carnegie broke ground on Carnegie Museums first major expansion in 1904. While the most famous product of that growth was the great Dinosaur Hall, its neighboring hall, the Hall of Architecture, perhaps best embodied Andrew Carnegies desire to bring the world to the people of Pittsburgh. He knew that most of those people would never leave their neighborhoods, their city, let alone the country. So he created a room filled with the casts of some of the greatest architectural wonders of the world. The hall itself is modeled after one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, and its rare collection of casts is the largest on display anywhere in the world today. A historic photo of the Oakland Museum The 1907 expansion A historic photo of the original dinosaur hall Early Dinosaur Hall a historic photo of the hall of architecture The Hall of Architecture Adding two new museums Carnegie Museums second most ambitious period of growth began in 1974, with the opening of the Sarah Scaife Galleries, which gave Carnegie Museum of Arts constantly growing collections their own elegant space. Between 1980 and 1993, Carnegie Museum of Natural History added a number of new exhibit halls: Hillman Hall of Minerals & Gems, Polar World, the Benedum Hall of Geology, the Walton Hall of Ancient Egypt, and the Hall of African Wildlife. The Carnegie In 1986, the expanding cultural powerhouse became known as The Carnegie, and to this day, many in the region still refer to Andrew Carnegies Pittsburgh museums as The Carnegie. In 1991, Carnegie Science Center entered the Carnegie Museums fold through a partnership between Carnegie Museums and the Buhl Foundation. Home to Buhl Planetarium, the Miniature Railroad & Village, and hundreds of interactive science exhibits, the Science Center now attracts more than half a million people a year. By the time of its 10-year anniversary in 2001, the Science Center opened Highmark SportsWorks, the largest collection of sports and science exhibits in the world. exterior view of Carnegige Science Center in 1991 Carnegie Science Center Three years later, Carnegie Museums again brought something new and irreplaceable to Pittsburgh, and the world: The Andy Warhol Museum. In addition to presenting the vast archives of Andy Warhol, the museum also has become a center for dialogue about a diverse range of topics, as well as a global ambassador to Pittsburghs cultural richness and diversity through its many traveling exhibitions. exterior of The Andy Warhol Museum The Andy Warhol Museum Todays ever-changing experiences By the year 2000, the four Carnegie Museums became known as Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh. The following two decades included the debut of Carnegie Museum of Natural Historys blockbuster Dinosaurs in Their Time exhibit, which is nearly three times the size of the original dinosaur hall and the first exhibit in the world to feature scientifically accurate, immersive environments spanning the Age of Dinosaurs. In 2003 and again in 2012, Carnegie Museum of Art accomplished its most important and most visitor-focused transformations since the opening of the Scaife wing with the reopening of its Scaife Galleries after year-long renovations, which included new presentations of its vast collections and the display of more artwork. In 2014, The Andy Warhol Museum rehung its collection, telling the story of Andy Warhols life and artwork chronologically for the first time to spectacular effect. In 2017, Carnegie Museums launched a collaborative event series, Carnegie Nexus, that reaches across the arts and sciences to design experiences that animate pressing issues of our time and instigate new ways to examine our world through live performance, the visual and literary arts, and thoughtful conversation. And in 2018, Carnegie Science Center completed a major expansion: PPG Science Pavilion, which houses a suite of STEM Learning Labs; a Special Exhibitions Gallery for large-scale changing exhibitions; a laser digital giant-screen theater; and outdoor learning spaces on the riverfront.",

    "https://www.heinzhistorycenter.org/about/": "The Senator John Heinz History Center is Pennsylvanias largest history museum and a proud affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution. Devoted to the history and heritage of Western Pennsylvania, our family of museums includes the Heinz History Center, Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, Fort Pitt Museum, and Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village. The History Center is home to the Thomas & Katherine Detre Library & Archives. Our mission is to engage and inspire large and diverse audiences through programs that enable links to the past, understanding in the present, and guidance for the future by preserving regional history and presenting the American experience with a Western Pennsylvania connection. This work is accomplished in partnership with others through archaeology, archives, artifact collections, broadcast and electronic media, civic engagement, conservation, educational programs, exhibitions, events, library, museums, public outreach, performance, preservation, publications, products, research, technical assistance, and virtual programs. Our Story The Senator John Heinz History Center traces its roots back to 1879, making it the oldest cultural institution in Western Pennsylvania. In 1879, the Old Residents of Pittsburgh and Western Pennsylvania established a historical society to help preserve local history. Five years later, the name changed to the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania and has been in continuous existence for more than 135 years. Originally, membership in the historical society was limited to men who had lived in the region for 50 years or more, though the rules changed within a few years to include women and younger people. In those days, members enjoyed lectures and country outings and got together to reminisce. Perhaps most importantly, early Historical Society members worked to preserve archival materials and objects of historic significance, forming the foundation of the History Centers collections. The Historical Society brought our regions history to the public. In 1908, it celebrated the regions 150th anniversary; in 1911, the centennial of steamboat navigation; in 1958, the regions bicentennial celebration; and in 2008, the regions 250th anniversary. These events served as the basis for the many events, publications, educational programs, and exhibitions that the History Center offers today. Early meetings of the Historical Society were held in members homes and churches, though a significant step was taken in 1893 when the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh at Schenley Park offered space for the archives. In 1914, after securing the funding, the Historical Society built its own building on Bigelow Blvd. In 1996, the History Center moved into its current home in Pittsburghs Strip District. With the opening of the Smithsonian wing in 2004, the History Center became the largest history museum in Pennsylvania. The new wing allows better opportunities found in our affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution. The additional space added the Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, the Mueller Education Center, the Special Collections Gallery, and the McGuinn Gallery for traveling exhibitions. Since its opening, the Smithsonian wing has been home to various exhibitions, including Pennsylvanias Civil War, Vatican Splendors, 1968: The Year that Rocked America, Pittsburghs Lost Steamboat: Treasures of the Arabia, We Can Do It! WWII, Toys of the 50s, 60s and 70s, #Pixburgh: A Photographic Experience, Destination Moon: The Apollo 11 Mission. In 2014, the History Center opened the new Museum Conservation Center, located directly behind the museum on Penn Avenue. The nine-story building houses the museums artifacts under one roof with Smithsonian-quality storage. Children playing on the trolley in the Great Hall of the Heinz History Center.
