Please visit https://pittsburgh.plowtracker.com/ Launch Fullscreen Map The Plow Tracker v 2.0 displays the history trail of Public Works vehicles conducting deicing and/or anti-icing and plowing operations. Vehicle travel on City streets is displayed with a pink history trail. Street treatment efforts can be tracked within the last 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours by selecting the desired interval below the map. Roads are color-coded to show the City’s treatment responsibilities. City Treatment Responsibility Other Treatment Responsibility Current vehicle location is displayed with a vehicle icon on the screen on the “Now” and 2, 4, 12, and 24 interval time displays. The Plow Tracker v 2.0 does not display the current location of vehicles traveling slower than 2.5 m.p.h., or if the ignition is off. To ensure drivers are able to treat the roads without interruption, vehicle icons are presented with a time delay. Users of the Plow Tracker 2.0 can zoom in on the map to view their street or select their street from the drop-down menu located below the history display buttons. Treatment is the application of anti-icing (before snow and ice arrive) and / or deicing (after snow / ice have fallen) materials. While their application indicates that the street has been treated it does not indicate that a street will be clear of any snow/ ice – that will happen when the temperatures are favorable (rising, not falling), the sun is prevalent and pedestrians and vehicles work the deicing and/or anti-icing material. Primary and secondary streets are treated simultaneously but during heavy snow or changing weather conditions Public Works vehicles may return to treating only primaries prior to returning to secondary and tertiary routes. The streets are categorized based on traffic volume. In addition to City streets, Public Works conducts deicing and/or anti-icing operations on certain Allegheny County, and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania roads. Later this winter weather season we will update the Plow Tracker map to display city snow and ice treatment responsibility. There are times that Public Works vehicles travel on streets they do not own or maintain: To apply deicing and/or anti-icing materials to streets during a winter weather event Public Works drivers may turn their vehicle around and back up steep hills because this is the most efficient and safest manner to treat the street. In other instances, drivers may encounter difficulty accessing narrow streets when cars are parked too far into the roadway. In such cases, the driver has to return in the hope the vehicle has moved or return with a smaller piece of equipment. For the 2018-19 winter weather season, Public Works is treating roads with a new rock salt made of Magnesium Chloride instead of Sodium Chloride treated with liquid Calcium Chloride. Magnesium Chloride is expected to have a lower melting point and better deicing capabilities, particularly at lower temperatures. Our new deicing material is treated with a blue pigment that enables residents and drivers to be better able to determine if the street has recently been treated. When driving: When parking: When shoveling: Please be patient and give our crews the time needed to treat over 1,200 miles of streets. Public Works classifies storm conditions into Levels, which determine the required response for a given winter weather event. Based on the Levels, residents and drivers can expect that all streets will be treated in the following manner. Know that while there are periods when it is not snowing, that does not mean the weather event has ended. Level 0: No service response required.

Read on to learn more about Feed the Hood, Knoxville’s Positivity Garden, and South Side Slopes Mission and Barry Streets Beautification. Feed the Hood was the first project under the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh’s Farm-A-Lot program. The URA and community partners organized to regenerate vacant green space into a place of healing and positive interaction in Homewood North. Using food and community engagement as the catalyst for this project, the Homewood Parklet was revitalized into an Orchard Park to help meet our mission to build positive relationships between people and food. Maintained green space also reduce violent crimes in high poverty areas. The Knoxville Community Council applied to maintain the Positivity Garden on Zara Street that was created by neighbors on Zara Street. In addition to making improvements to the garden, the Council wanted to expand its impact by doing neighborhood clean ups with a focus on picking up litter and removing overgrowth throughout the neighborhood. Grantees have said that without this funding, they would have had to close this garden as they simply couldn't do it without the grant’s help. In the South Side Slopes, the application proposed a beautification project at the intersection of Mission and Barry Streets at the bottom of the Mission Street public staircase. The main focus was to organize general cleanup, cut back and remove of weeds and overgrowth, focusing on the corner and public staircase along both sides of steps at that location.

USDA (US Department of Agriculture protocol) How to Build a Spotted Lanternfly Circle Trap (psu.edu) As far as a chemical control goes, this is what Penn State University has. Spotted Lanternfly Management and Pesticide Safety Article Chemical Treatment Cost Prohibited and Non-Effective in Long Run Systemic control, injection, $15 an inch of trunk diameter, so for example a 10 inch street tree would cost around $150.00 and wouldn't help with the lanternflies on nearby grape vines and porcelain berry, so it would have a primarily cosmetic effect for a couple of weeks. It would take months to inject all of the trees, by which point the season would be coming to a close. Foliar spraying would be faster, but significantly more dangerous to both the safety of our water supplies, native insect and reptile species, pets, and park-users, and pedestrians, as it would involve essentially fogging the forest or streets with insecticides. It would work for a couple of weeks, and then they would move in from the surrounding infected parts of the County and City and we'd be back to square one.

To support the city’s rapidly growing event & film industry, the Office of Film & Event Management has streamlined the permitting process for event organizers and film producers via efficient digital permitting. In addition to streamlining the permitting process for events & film projects in the City of Pittsburgh, the Office of Film & Event Management will also be responsible for the following: OFEM is tasked with receiving and vetting applications for small and large-scale events and film productions within the City of Pittsburgh as well as consulting with both film and event permit applicants to ensure that industry standards, safety regulations, and city policies are followed and met. Via the Special Events Committee, OFEM also works with all City departments to ensure proper planning, coordination, and execution of all events and film projects. Additionally, it will ensure that events and film productions do not negatively impact the City’s operations and remain positive assets to the City and its residents. Beginning in the spring of 2024, the Office of Film & Event Management (OFEM) launched a new permit management system, Eproval! With the launch of this new system came a new two-phase application approach to special event permitting. The new process allowed event organizers to secure their preferred venue first, and then focus on the details of the event. Previously, applicants had to wait until many details of their event were in place before they could apply. Now, applicants could secure their venue and dates, then move forward with hiring all of their vendors and performers with the comfort of knowing they had a secure venue and dates. Please see the release below for more information on EProval, and please visit the Special Event & Block Party Permitting page for information on the new application process. Please check out the 'Getting Started: Event Permits' document under the 'Important Documents' tab on the left for information on the entire permitting process! In addition to being able to secure their event venue prior to completing all event-specific details, Eproval provides several new exciting features that will make the event permitting process more streamlined for applicants. Among them: Scalable Application: During Phase Two of the application, applicants will be asked a series of yes/no questions up front, such as but not limited to: “will your event have a stage?” and “will you be having fireworks?” This allows the system to custom build an application specific to that event. If the event takes place in a park and does not impact any roadways, the applicant will not be presented with questions about road closures. If an event will not have fireworks, the applicant will not have to answer any questions about fireworks. This will minimize the length of the application for small community events, while larger more complex events will require more information. Public Event Calendar: During the application process, applicants will be given the opportunity to opt-in to our brand new public event calendar. This will be a forward facing calendar that will list all pending and approved event applications. Applicants who opt into being on the calendar can provide contact info and website information, as well as a quick two to three sentence marketing pitch. This calendar will be available on the City’s website for anyone to find when looking for things to do in the City.

The new process will allow event organizers to secure their preferred venue first, and then focus on the details of the event. Previously, applicants would need to wait until many details of their event were in place before they could apply. Now, applicants can secure their venue and dates, then move forward with hiring all of their vendors and performers with the comfort of knowing they have a secure venue and dates. Note: Block Party Permit applications do not follow the two phase approach and will maintain their traditional application & approval procedures. The new process is separated into two distinct phases: The first step in securing a special event permit will now be completing and submitting the Reservation of Space application. This application will include mostly high-level details: contact info, venue, dates, times, routes (if a run/walk etc), and basic event concept information. Per City code, this ROS application can be submitted up to 180 business days before the first permitted event date (“on-site date”, i.e. when set up would begin). To submit this application, event organizers do not need to provide site maps, insurance, vendor details, or any granular information at this time. The $25 application processing fee will be charged at submission of the ROS application. Once received, the ROS application will be reviewed by relevant stakeholders on the City’s Special Events Committee (SEC) to determine if the requested venue is available on the dates requested, that construction or other potential conflicts do not exist or can be mediated, and if resources are available to accommodate the event. Should all these conditions be met, the ROS application will be approved. At this time, OFEM will approve the ROS application and release to the applicant Phase Two of the Special Event Permit application, and the applicant can move forward with procuring all the necessary amenities for their event knowing their venue and dates are secure. Please note, an approval of the ROS application is not a full approval to proceed with the event, it merely commits the venue to the event. Full approval does not occur until Phase Two of the application is complete. Upon approval of the ROS application, Phase Two of the application will be released to the applicant. It is at this time that all remaining relevant details of the event must be provided. These details include site maps, insurance, specific event timelines, any Public Safety needs, needed City resources, and entertainment information, among other things. The Phase Two application can be submitted whenever complete, but will be due to OFEM no later than fourteen (14) business days prior to the on-site date. Once submitted, the Phase Two application will be reviewed by the SEC. If there are issues with the Phase Two application during review, the application will follow the current process of OFEM working with the applicant to resolve any outstanding concerns and endeavor to get the application to an approvable state. If approved, the applicant will receive their permit and invoice for any relevant charges, including the permit fee. It is at this time the event will be considered fully approved and permitted. A \"block party\" means a one-day outdoor public event organized by the residents of a City block and held upon a City right-of-way for social or entertainment purposes. Block Party permits are limited to “Residential” districts as defined in the Zoning Code and limited to one (1) city block. The activities that take place at a block party are up to the imagination of the residents and can include casual conversation, cook outs, pot luck dinners, games for children, and/or entertainment. Block parties are designed to take place in the street and on the sidewalks of the requested block. To enhance the sense of community, the City allows the street to be closed to traffic. In addition, having a Block Party Permit provides an exemption from some portions of the City’s noise ordinance, thus allowing you to play music using amplifiers that would otherwise be prohibited in public. Finally, Block Party Permits are exempt from the City’s “Open Container” law, thus allowing public consumption of alcohol by attendees of legal age at an approved block party, only on the block identified by the permit. Block Party Permit applications must be submitted at least seven (7) business days prior to the event date to ensure proper time for review. Additionally, block party permits can only be written for weekends and federal holidays, and are only valid between the hours of 10:00am and 10:00pm. While not a federal holiday, block party permits can be issued for Halloween as a means for creating safe trick or treating environments in neighborhoods. All other conditions of a block party permit must still be met for those occurring on Halloween. Lastly, Block party permits cannot be issued for private events, including but not limited to: wedding receptions, birthday parties, graduations or family reunions. Block Party permits also cannot be issued to create venues for artist markets, farmers markets, or other for-profit ventures. These events can apply for Special Event Permits per the conditions of those permits. NOTE: Block Party permits are not subject to the above two-phase application process and remain a single submission application. Please note: both Phase One and Phase Two of an event application must be completed no later than 14 business days before the on-site time. Please allow yourself enough time for both phases of the application to be approved at least 14 days before your event. To begin your application process, please click below to launch Eproval.

The Special Events Committee is a group of representatives from various City departments, including but not limited to Public Safety, Public Works, Parks & Recreation, Emergency Management, and Pittsburgh Regional Transit. This group meets every Tuesday morning to discuss the applications received the previous week, and to continue discussion on any applications that have been held over from the previous week. Once the Reservation of Space application is approved and an applicant has received, completed, and submitted their Phase Two Special Event application, the members of the SEC will review the Phase Two application in the same manner, leading to a full approval of an application. The job of this committee is to review each application and determine if the proposed event is viable, make sure the dates and locations requested are available, ensure that proper procedure is being followed, and that any needed City resources are properly allocated and not over-booked. If necessary, the committee may request that an organizer attend a committee meeting to further discuss their proposed event, and to work one-on-one with department representatives to iron out any needs from the respective departments. The members of the Special Events Committee are as follows.

Explore this website to learn about its dynamic history and find out how to visit our historic home! The City-County Building under construction in 1915. The City-County Building shortly after completion in 1917. The City-County Building today. Whether you are visiting the Mayor, speaking to Council, getting your marriage license, or just love architecture, we want you to join our century of memories! Use the hashtag #PghCCB to share your photos! In 1794, the newly formed Borough of Pittsburgh established a Public Market House in the current location of Market Square. Aside from creating the public market tradition that continues there today, this location was also home to the very first Pittsburgh Municipal Hall. As Pittsburgh continued to grow, so would the space required for government services. The Market House quickly became obsolete and the cornerstone of a new City Hall was laid at Smithfield Street and Oliver Avenue in May of 1869. The County, which first courthouse was also in this location moved to its current location on Grant Street in 1836. The Smithield Street City Hall would serve until the completion of the City-County Building in 1917. It would sit abandoned for 50 years before sold for a redevelopment in the 1950's. The first City Hall at Market Square. The second City Hall on Smithfield Street. Mayor David Lawrence strikes the first blow for the demolition of the second City Hall. In 1911, a City of Pittsburgh Commission was formed by unanimous resolution of Council for the construction of a new City Hall. The Commission, which by 1913 had been joined by the appropriate members representing Allegheny County, employed New York architect Cass Gilbert to arrange a competition for the design of a new municipal building. Of the 16 entries, the winning design was submitted by the firm Palmer, Hornbostel, & Jones of New York, who were represented locally by Edward B. Lee. The plans were officially adopted on January 19, 1914, and began the following year. The building acted as a gift to Pittsburgh to honor the 1916 Centennial of Pittsburgh's 1816 incorporation as a City. At the March 1916 dedication ceremony, Mayor Joseph Armstrong placed a time capsule into the still under construction building. Two and a half years later in December 1917, he would become the first Mayor to call the City-County Building a second home. The missing time capsule has yet to be discovered. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette announces Pittsburgh's 1916 Centennial and the construction of a new City Hall. Mayor Armstrong places a newspaper in the time capsule to be buried in the City-County Building. The shovel used in the groundbreaking ceremony of the City-County Building. The City-County Building under construction in 1916. The Grand Lobby of the City-County Building, is one of the building's most beautiful spaces. The room extends the length of the building, connecting Grant Street to Ross Street. The 30-foot wide hall is topped off by a 47-foot high barrel-vaulted ceiling. On the first floor, the marble lined hall is flanked by a series of row offices that contain the public service offices most often visited - the County's marriage license and passports, and Pittsburgh's Controller, and Treasury offices. The offices form a base on which sit the bronze classical columns that support the vaulted ceiling. The columns are works of art themselves, manufactured by Louis Tiffany Studios. They feature, in a rotating series at their bases, the Seals of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, as well as iconic local frontiersman Guyasuta and Pittsburgh's oldest surviving building, the Fort Pitt Blockhouse. The rooms ornate elevator doors feature a series of reliefs detailing the previous homes of municipal government. The reliefs age with the building's they clutch, reaching adulthood with the present City-County Building and Allegheny County Courthouse. The Grand Lobby of the City-County Building. In 1972 the City of Pittsburgh moved Phipps Fall Flower show to the City-County Building. It would return to Phipps Conservatory in 1975. The ornate elevator doors. The offical statue of Sir William Pitt was a gift to Pittsburgh from Sir Charles Wakefield Baronet, the former Lord Mayor of London in 1922. The place where much of Pittsburgh's future was shaped, the Office of the Mayor, has played the role of a second home to every Cheif Executive of Pittsburgh since 1917. These two state rooms have gone virtually unchanged in the last century. Most of the furniture, including the iconic Desk, are original to the building's opening and were custom designed by Hornbostel. The central hall features the offical portraits of Pittsburgh's Mayors. The Office of the Mayor at completion in 1917. Mayor Kline with guests in the Mayor's Conference Room in 1929.

In addition it includes the dates of the completion of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions.

The initiative aims to enhance the work already being done by climate-forward mayors across the U.S. by providing support for cities to design climate programs that fully seize the historic opportunity to access and implement federal funds to advance transformative changes. Data shows that major sources of harmful pollution are disproportionately located in communities of Black people and people of color living on low incomes. Through Bloomberg American Sustainable Cities, i-teams will focus on building relationships in these communities and work alongside them to advance innovative projects that provide cleaner air, improved public health, a stronger economy with clean energy jobs, and the promise of a more equitable, sustainable future. The Pittsburgh i-team is focused on two key City priorities: advancing initiatives to electrify, weatherize, and install solar systems in the homes of under-resourced residents, while simultaneously expanding workforce opportunities and creating clean energy career pathways for disadvantaged workers. These efforts also aim to support minority- and women-owned businesses in the region. Dr. Daren A. Ellerbee, i-team Director, and Elliott Williams, i-team Civic Designer, will lead this work in Pittsburgh. For more information, please visit Bloomberg American Sustainable Cities.

A record is not a public record if: Generally, public records are to be open for inspection or duplication in accordance with the RTKL. Records are to be provided in the medium requested if they exist in that medium. Otherwise, they are to be provided in the medium in which they exist. The RTKL does not require the City to give computer access to any requester. When responding to a request, the City is not required to create a record that does not presently exist. Nor is the City required to compile, maintain, format, or organize a record in a manner in which the City does not currently maintain, format, or organize the record.

Please, read and accept changes. Effective date: December 04, 2023 NEOGOV PRIVACY POLICY The purpose of this Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is to describe how we collect, use, store, protect, and disclose personal data online and offline either via our websites or related applications. This Policy applies to personal data we collect or use, and applications owned or controlled by Govermentjobs.com, Inc. (DBA “NEOGOV”), including our related brands NEOGOV.com, NEOED.com, PowerDMS.com, Governmentjobs.com, Schooljobs.com, and our mobile app(s) (collectively referred to as the “Services”), or affiliated companies (collectively referred to herein as “Governmentjobs”, \"Schooljobs\", “NEOGOV”, “NEOED”, “PowerDMS”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). By using any part of the Services you agree that you have read this Policy, your personal data will be processed as described herein, and you agree to be bound by this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into our Terms of Use. Definitions not explicitly defined herein shall retain the meaning as prescribed in the Terms of Use. Any dispute related to privacy is subject to the Terms of Use and this Policy, including limitations on liability. This Policy does not apply to (1) personal data controlled by our Customers (employers that utilize our Services, described further below), which is governed by our separate agreements and related data processing agreements with such Customers; (2) personal data collected by unaffiliated sites that link to or are accessible from our Services; (3) personal data our partners may collect directly from you and control; (4) personal data collected and processed by us about our employees or job applicants responding to our job offers; and, (5) non-personal data derived from personal data, including any data that is aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized, statistical data, insights, or other predictive data that is sufficiently different from your personal data that it cannot be reversed engineered through reasonable means, or otherwise identified from analysis or further processing of the derived data (collectively referred to as the “De-Identified Platform Data”). We use De-Identified Platform Data to provide Customers with useful and relevant insights, build features and data services, and improve our Services. Because De-Identified Platform Data does not identify you personally, we can use and disclose it in our discretion. We are the controller for the personal data discussed in this Policy, except as noted in the “Where We Are a Service Provider” section below. Our Customers are organizations such as federal, state, local, tribal, or other municipal government agencies (including administrative agencies, departments, and offices thereof), private businesses, and educational institutions (including without limitation K-12 schools, colleges, universities, and vocational schools), who use our Services to evaluate job applicants and/or manage their relationship with their personnel. When we provide our Services to our Customers, the Customer generally controls and manages the personal data (which may include sensitive personal data such as biometric information for timeclock tracking, your precise geolocation information, health information, and demographic information like race and ethnicity related to the employment relationship), and we process personal data as a \"data processor\" or \"service provider\" (as these terms are defined in applicable data protection laws). Our legal obligations as a processor and service provider are set out in our Customer contracts and policies. Our Customers, and not us, decide what types of personal data to collect to manage their relationships with you. For instance, if you apply to a job or your employer utilizes our Services to manage their relationship with you, the personal data collected about you is generally controlled by the employer (our Customer). This Policy does not describe the processing of your personal data by our Customers, and we encourage you to visit the Customer’s privacy policy for information about their privacy practices. For example, if you applied to a job at a local state agency, you should contact that agency with any questions you may have relating to the personal data processing by that state agency within our Services. Where we serve as a data processor or service provider, our Customer contracts and policies require us to either instruct you to contact our Customer, or redirect your inquiry to our Customer. In this Section we set out general categories of personal data we may collect and the purpose for using your personal data, including the personal data collected and processed over the past year. We collect and process personal data to provide you the Services, fulfill our contractual responsibility to deliver the Services to our Customers, fulfill your requests, and pursue our legitimate interests and our business and commercial purposes. We also automatically collect data during your usage of the Services and collect other personal data about you from other sources.

Under the CCPA, “sharing” is defined as the targeting of advertising to a consumer based on that consumer’s personal information obtained from the consumer’s activity across websites, and “selling” is defined as the disclosure of personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration. Our use of third-party analytics services and online advertising services as discussed in detail in our Privacy Policy may result in the sharing of online identifiers (e.g., cookie data, IP addresses, device identifiers, and usage information) in a way that may be considered a “sale” under the CCPA.

Please note, in the limited circumstances that we process sensitive personal information (such as health information, ethnicity, and biometric information) as defined in the CCPA, we do not use or disclose it other than for disclosed and permitted business purposes for which there is not a right to limit under the CCPA. Shine the Light California Law permits customers who are California residents to request certain information once per year regarding our disclosure of “personal information” (as that term is defined under applicable California law) to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please email us at privacy@neogov.com. Do Not Track Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. Except as otherwise described herein with respect to legally required browser based opt outs, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as there is no industry-wide framework for DNT signals. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so here. Data Controllers and Processors. Our Customers use our Services to post job opportunities, evaluate job applicants, manage their human resource activities, and train their workforce. In conducting these activities, the Customer maintains control over what personal data is collected, how it is used, how long it is retained, and who it is disclosed to. For purposes of the EU GDPR, the Customer is considered a data controller in these respects and we are a data processor. In other instances, such as when we use cookies or contact you about our Services, we will determine the means and purpose of processing. Lawful Basis for Processing. For personal data subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and ePrivacy Directive, we rely on multiple legal bases for processing, including: Consent. In certain cases, we ask you for your consent to process your personal data, for instance, for certain marketing purposes. You can withdraw your consent at any time; however, this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before your consent was withdrawn. You can withdraw your consent by using the prompts within the messages you receive, the settings within your account, or by contacting our support using any of the privacy support emails listed at the end of this Policy. Legitimate Interest. We process certain personal data for our legitimate interests. These legitimate interests include contacting you to provide support or sending you marketing information (subject to applicable law); detecting, preventing, and investigating illegal activities and potential security issues; and maintaining and improving our Services. We will balance our interests, the purpose and necessity of processing, and the rights and risks to you before we process for legitimate interests. Performance of a Contract We process personal data to perform our obligations under an agreement with you or our Customers. For example, we use payment information you provide when you purchase a Service. Other Legal Bases. In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to process your personal data, such as in response to a court or regulator order. We also may need to process your personal data to protect vital interests, or to exercise, establish, or defend legal claims. Automated Decision Making and Profiling. We use an automated chat bot within some of our Services to screen your requests and questions. The purpose of the automated chat bot is to fulfill frequently asked questions provided by our users, tag the requests and questions to route to our most appropriate contact, and improve our responses and Services. The chat bot is not fully automated and will not have a legal or significant impact on you. We implement physical, technical, and administrative safeguards designed to maintain data accuracy, integrity, and security, prevent unauthorized access, and facilitate correct use of personal data. Our security measures take into account the risk of harm to you and Customers, as well as the availability of technology, industry common practices, effectiveness of mitigation controls, and the sustainability of those controls by us. Although we maintain the controls listed herein, transmission of data is not without risk and the complete security of your personal data cannot be guaranteed. Please note, you are responsible for keeping your login credentials secret at all times, including your username and password. For personal data we determine the purposes for and means by which it is processed, such personal data will not be kept for longer than necessary for the original purpose of collection, when no longer relevant, or upon permissible request. When the original purpose no longer exists, we will either delete or de-identify it (subject to applicable law) or, if this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data until deletion is possible. Your personal data will be appropriately disposed in a manner designed to ensure it cannot be reconstructed or read. If you are a job applicant, after your account has been closed, we may retain De-Identified Platform Data as permitted by law. Where our Customer is the controller of your personal data, our retention policies and procedures are designed to allow Customers to comply with their own record retention requirements. If you are a job applicant that deletes your profile with us, your personal data will be removed or de-identified with our job applicant database; however, your data may persist within the applications you previously submit to our Customers until Customer disposal. Job applicants should contact the Customer they sent the application to if they seek enforcement of eligible data rights in that application. We reserve the right to revise our Policy to reflect changes in our online information practices or to comply with the law by publishing a new version on our website. In circumstances where we materially change this Policy, we will provide you with appropriate notice in accordance with legal requirements.

Residents must call \"311\" and request rodent bait, provide their name, phone number, and address. A contractor will place one pet-safe baiting station on your property, good for about 200 rats or mice. The contractor will not usually make contact with you and will try to place the station discreetly unless a specific location is requested. The rodents will find the station from other areas of the property. After approximately one month, the contractor will return and check the station, replacing the bait if needed. After about two months, the station will be removed. Only the owner or resident of a property can make the request for their home. The contractor cannot place stations on abandoned properties, empty lots or public ways. The program does not cover apartment buildings with more than four units or businesses. More severe issues at residential properties may have to be addressed privately. Issues creating or aggravating the problem, such as trash violations or poor property maintenance, should be reported to PLI through 311 for inspection. The contractor does their best to fulfill requests in a timely manner, but due to the irregularity of the volume of requests and depending on the time of year, there may be a delay of up to several weeks in placing the station initially.

For more animal specific solutions, check out the Humane Action Pittsburgh's \"Love Your Wild Neighbor\" tips at LoveYourWildNeighbor.org then select the animal from the directory. Sometimes an animal has already entered your home or is causing damage to your property. Nuisance wildlife is defined as wildlife that causes, or is about to cause, property damage or that exhibits unusual behavior that may indicate a threat to the health or safety of the community by means of disease transmission or direct attacks. If there is an animal inside your home, please call the office directly for immediate assistance. It’s important to remember that live trapping wild animals only temporarily solves a problem. Many studies have shown that live trapping wild animals actually creates a vacuum that allows more animals to move into that now open area. Also, less competition for food among wild animals means that more offspring will be born each year. There are many cities as large or larger than Pittsburgh with about the same wild animal population that do not allow their residents to live trap any wild animals. These city residents have learned how to live with the wild animals in their respective cities.

Please contact the office at 412-255-2036, Monday through Friday from 7am to 3pm to discuss trapping. Losing a pet can be a very stressful experience. Following these steps can help reunite you with your lost pet more quickly: We're glad you asked! Cats with an ear that is \"tipped\" or notched (see photo) aren't really strays. They are feral cats. This means the cats are not tame, but they are cared for by someone in your neighborhood. A cat with a tipped ear has been spayed or neutered and vaccinated against rabies. These cats help to keep rodent populations in check. They are no danger to residents, but should not be approached, as they are essentially wild. For more information on feral cats, please check out www.alleycat.org or call the Animal Care and Control office at 412-255-2036 Monday through Friday, 7am to 3pm.

Pittsburgh EMS is dedicated to serving the needs of the public. Special Operations makes its personnel available and prepared at each one of these events with an array of equipment should any problems present themselves. Pittsburgh EMS has four specially equipped Harley Davison Motorcycles containing Advanced Life Support equipment. Paramedics specially trained in how to safely operate these motorcycles use them to quickly maneuver through traffic and crowds at large outdoor events and many places that a normal ambulance cannot fit. The Motorcycle Unit is often credited with performing lifesaving interventions in areas that would be difficult to access by typical field units. Pittsburgh EMS utilizes bicycles to provide medical coverage for large spectator events. These bicycles, staffed with paramedics and ALS equipment, are able to offer medical care faster than the traditional method when dealing with large crowds. The bicycles also offer to the paramedics the ability to traverse difficult terrain that would otherwise only be accessible by foot. To inquire about special event scheduling, please call the EMS office at 412-622-6930. The City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Emergency Medical Services Honor Guard was established in February of 1995. An EMS Honor Guard was needed to help honor three City of Pittsburgh Firefighters that tragically lost their lives in a structure fire on Valentine's Day. Since then, the Honor Guard has grown from three initial members to the 15 dedicated members that provide this distinguished service today. All members are City of Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS Paramedics or Paramedic Crew Chiefs. The Honor Guard is busy throughout the year, providing services at different details. Some of these details include parades, banquets, dedications, memorial services, funerals, conferences and inaugurations. The Honor Guard has traveled out of state for several ceremonial details. The annual signature event for the Honor Guard is held each year during May, when the National EMS Memorial Service is held in Roanoke, Virginia. At this event, EMS agencies from across the nation take the time to honor those pre-hospital EMS personnel who have made the \"Ultimate Sacrifice,\" losing their lives in the line of duty. If interested in requesting the presence of the City of Pittsburgh EMS Honor Guard, please contact: Division Chief Paul A. Sabol, NRP Cell: 412-475-0854 Office: 412-622-6931 Paul.Sabol@pittsburghpa.gov City of Pittsburgh 414 Grant St. Pittsburgh, PA 15219 (Accessibility entrance on Ross St.) View on Map 412-255-2621\n================================================================================\n\nTitle: Training Division - Pittsburgh, PA\nContent: In This Section City of Pittsburgh Paramedics are certified through the Pennsylvania Department of Health. Many of our Paramedics have also obtained certification through the National Registry of EMTs gaining them certification as a Nationally Registered Paramedic. New Paramedics and EMTs are also instructed through a joint effort between Pittsburgh EMS and the Center for Emergency Medicine. Training to become a Paramedic requires thousands of hours of preparation, dedication and hard work. Paramedics are constantly updating themselves and the equipment and skills required to perform at their best. It is the role of the Training Division to keep the Paramedics prepared for whatever they may encounter. Paramedics of Pittsburgh EMS continue their education and maintaining certification by attending a minimum of 24 hours of continuing education classes each year. To ensure that every Paramedic receives annual training, the Bureau of Emergency Medical Services developed the EMS Training Division to handle the task of education. The division consists of three Paramedic Crew Chiefs assigned as training officers to handle the workload. In addition, other field personnel with specialized training are brought into the Division as needed to assist in training subjects that are not part of everyday, routine operations. There are also many Paramedic Crew Chiefs trained as Field Training Officers to assist in the hands-on training that is given to many Paramedic students, emergency physician residents, RNs and so on. Many of our Paramedics are certified as instructors and evaluators in a wide range of related Public Safety disciplines. These include Emergency Medicine, Rescue, Hazardous Materials and more. These Pittsburgh Paramedics routinely share their knowledge and skills with responders from throughout Pennsylvania and, indeed, the entire nation. Many of our personnel are among the most sought after technical instructors in their fields of expertise. The Training Division also provides a range of educational opportunities to other City bureaus and departments as well as the public at large. The Training Division assists in facilitating CPR/AED (automatic external defibrillator) classes for other City of Pittsburgh departments and neighborhood groups. The Training Division also teaches the First Responder program for all of the City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officers and recruits. City of Pittsburgh Paramedics receive their medical direction/command through the Center for Emergency Medicine and work under the guidance of our Medical Director, Dr. Ronald Roth. We also share a unique relationship with the University of Pittsburgh's affiliated Residency in Emergency Medicine which, on select calls, allows for an emergency physician to respond to the scene of an emergency.

Our mission is to serve marginalized communities that have been systematically isolated from society and victimized by an unjust system. Through the tireless work of our frontline workers, public safety liaisons, and subject matter experts we aim to address the needs of those living in poverty, experiencing homelessness or housing instability, substance use disorder, and mental or behavioral health challenges. It is our goal that our most vulnerable residents can be embraced by their neighbors and welcomed back in their communities. The Office of Community Health & Safety has piloted novel yet best-practice driven programs such as Co-Response, Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion, Trauma Survivor’s Assistance, People In Need of Support, Post Overdose Support Team, and Reaching Out On The Streets. From helping family survivors of suicide and gun violence to those experiencing homelessness, each of these programs focuses on centering individual needs and reducing harm. The Office of Community Health and Safety was announced in 2020, and since then we have sought not only to support community members who need assistance but do so in a financially responsible manner. We have successfully applied for numerous state and federal grants, funding our Post Overdose Support Team and Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion program through federal funding mechanisms. Our partners in the Pittsburgh Bureaus of Police, Fire, and Emergency Medical Services are also indispensable as we connect community members who utilize 911 with longer term support. Central to our mission is to listen to the voices of all our community members and ensure that our programs serve those in need, especially those who have experienced historical and structural inequities and discrimination. Our programs are all voluntary, person centered, trauma informed and built on the principles of harm reduction. We are a team of Community Social Workers, Police Officers, Firefighters, Paramedics, EMTs, programming staff, and most of all – all passionate Pittsburgh residents working towards common goals. Though the challenges we face are formidable, with the partnership of communities throughout the City of Pittsburgh we are confident we can truly make Pittsburgh a safer, healthier, and more equitable city. Camila Alarcon-Chelecki Assistant Director, Office of Community Health & Safety Through continued collaboration with first responders and community members, analysis of calls for service, mapping of existing services, development of new partnerships, and evaluation of existing models, the Office of Community Health & Safety (OCH&S) will improve upon the existing continuum of resources and responses to address community unmet social service needs that are often encountered by Public Safety partners. First responder social support referrals, case conferencing and review, and service gap analysis will be utilized to enhance this continuum. Co-Response, People In Need of Support (PINS), and the Trauma Survivor’s Assistance Program (TSAP) constitute the Continuum of Support and additional information regarding each of those programs is directly below. Contact Katelyn Zeak Social Work Manager Katelyn.Zeak@pittsburghpa.gov The Co-Response program has been developed to provide the “right responders” to individuals who are experiencing a mental health or behavioral crisis. Teams consist of a Community Social Worker and dedicated Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officer who are dispatched to co-respond to individuals in crisis. Through trust-building and the provision of services, Co-Response seeks to reduce the propensity for individuals who experience mental and behavioral health crises to engage in violent behavior and become involved in the criminal justice system. Through the reduction in use of force, the program also aims to increase both the officer and community member’s safety. This will be supported by training Co-Response Officers on Crisis Response Intervention Training (CRIT), a national best-practice model rolled out by the Department of Justice. The PINS program developed as a partnership between the three Public Safety Bureaus and the Office of Community Health & Safety. First responders identify and refer City residents who frequently utilize 9-1-1 services to meet their basic needs, as well as individuals who may be vulnerable to harm and need follow up. Community Social Workers and Public Safety liaisons conduct home visits to assess the health and social needs of these residents and develop a plan to link the residents to services and resources (including CIT and FBI cases). High utilizers also known as \"frequent flyers\" who disproportionately utilize 9-1-1 services place strain upon the emergency response system. By connecting these individuals to long-term services and supports, we relieve pressure on the systems in place to assist people who experience crises. Nationally, these programs are known to provide systems-level cost-savings. The Trauma Survivors Assistance Program (TSAP) is a partnership between the Office of Community Health & Safety (OCHS) and the three Bureaus of Public Safety. TSAP social workers engage with victims of crime and survivors of trauma to provide emotional support and link them to appropriate trauma and crisis response services to stabilize them and begin the process of healing. TSAP also provides community trauma response following shootings and other instances of violence, providing a supportive debriefing space and linkage to resources in a larger group setting. Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) is an effective, replicable, and equitable diversion method that provides individuals with intense case management. It is a client-based approach that provides people with substance use disorder and mental and behavioral health challenges, experiencing homelessness and poverty with person-centered social services and intense case management focused on harm reduction and compassion in lieu of criminalization. The goal of LEAD is to break with traditional methods rooted in coercion and punishment to address the needs of individuals experiencing poverty, homelessness, substance use disorder, and mental and behavioral health challenges. LEAD combats racial and ethnic disparities within the criminal-legal system that have been perpetuated by harmful systems, stigmatization and lack of access to services. The initiative ignites a pathway towards criminal justice reform specifically to end harmful policing and criminalizing minorities and vulnerable populations. The mission of LEAD for the City of Pittsburgh is to reduce criminal-legal system engagement, promote individual agency, and provide care and support to people who use drugs, people with mental and behavioral health challenges, and people experiencing homelessness through person-centered social services. LEAD will combat racial and ethnic disparities within the criminal-legal system that have been perpetuated by harmful systems, stigmatization, and lack of access to services. LEAD is currently operating in Zones 1 and 2 and will be expanding to other zones. Contact Stephen Gress LEAD Program Manager Stephen.Gress@pittsburghpa.gov The Post Overdose Support Team (POST) responds to overdoses with teams of certified peer recovery specialists (CPRSs) and case managers to reach individuals at the time of interception with public safety personnel. The response aims to enable the POST team to foster a connection that places the individual in a deescalated state following the overdose, allowing us to begin the work of providing service connections that can lead to long-term recovery. Many people who have overdosed refuse transport to the hospital by EMS. This affords the POST team its opportunity. Trust-building that follows de-escalation is an integral initial step in order to facilitate the willingness of the individual to continue to engage POST staff after EMS has departed. to ensure that the provision of service connections and system navigation may continue. The responding team and follow-up case management staff identifies its primary goals to support safety, recovery, and to provide service connections that aim to treat substance use and/or co-occurring mental health disorders. Contact Heidi Allison POST Program Manager Heidi.M.Allison@pittsburghpa.gov The Reaching Out On The Streets (ROOTS) Program aims to reduce the prevalence of homelessness by addressing the social determinants of health, opening opportunities for personal agency, and intervening in critical moments of crisis to reduce criminal legal interactions, increase access to services, and reduce fatal overdoses. ROOTS will incorporate two components at full implementation: street outreach and drop-in sites. The staffing plan and organization align to support these programs. Interdisciplinary Zone Teams will meet the needs of individuals within the hyper-local scope of available services. Interdisciplinary Zone Teams include members from street outreach, sites, and diversion programs that coordinate participant care and are adaptable to complex needs; such as, human services, drug and alcohol treatment, housing, healthcare, behavioral health, and criminal legal navigation. Contact Ben Talik ROOTS Program Manager Benjamin.Talik@pittsburghpa.gov Continued community engagement, transparency, and accountability to the community and first responders is critical to building trust and facilitating change in the current response continuum. OCH&S will continue to sustain a collaborative model of program development and evaluation, prioritizing continuous review to ensure that deficits are quickly addressed and used for growth. OCH&S will partner with existing community organizations and prioritize community members who have been harmed and may not engage in traditional meetings. Initial efforts will focus on creation of multiple advisory collaboratives focused on Black neighborhoods most harmed by the war on drugs and systemic racism. The Office of Community Health and Safety community engagement team seeks to build relationships and trust between the office and diverse communities in the City of Pittsburgh while leveraging best practices in community outreach and community engagement. Staff will accomplish their mission by developing programs and other initiatives in partnership with the community to enhance the quality of life, safety, and security of our community.

Fentanyl is an extremely potent opioid that can quickly stop your breathing and cause an opioid overdose, which can lead to death. Any substance not obtained directly from a pharmacy or other licensed medical professional has the potential to contain fentanyl. This includes, but is not limited to heroin, cocaine, crack, methamphetamine, benzodiazepines, ecstasy, and counterfeit pills such as Percocet and Xanax. While fentanyl has been present in the heroin supply for several years in this region, there are increasing reports of other, non-opioid drugs that have been cut with or contaminated by fentanyl. There are several strategies that can be used to increase safety when using drugs: Overdoses can be fatal within a very brief period of time. 9-1-1 dispatchers will quickly send first responders to help and can provide guidance on how to respond to a suspected overdose. Pennsylvania Act 139 provides certain legal protection for the person experiencing the overdose as well as the caller, provided they stay with the victim. This protection is for a drug overdose only. Read more about Act 139. Narcan (naloxone) is a safe and legal medication that can reverse an opioid overdose and enable breathing. Narcan is not harmful to a person who is not experiencing an overdose, so there is no risk in administering it. Narcan can be purchased at any pharmacy and is covered by most insurance plans.

All applicants must be at least 18 years of age, possess a valid Class C Pennsylvania Driver’s License, must pass a background check, and are required to be City of Pittsburgh residents throughout the duration of their employment. There are other requirements too, according to veteran City of Pittsburgh Crossing Guard, Marlene Lamanna. “You must be able to tolerate all weather, be willing to travel around the city and, most importantly, you have to really love children,” says Lamanna. But after 41 years on the job, she says the latter requirement is the best part. “You’re basically the first person they see in the morning and they share everything with us,” she said. And that, Lamanna says, can lead to life-long friendships. “We see generations,” Lamanna said. “People we crossed as children will now come back with their own children.” Apply directly on the City of Pittsburgh website: https://www.governmentjobs.com/careers/Pittsburgh/jobs/2298155/school-crossing-guard?keywords=School%20Guard%20Crossing&pagetype=jobOpportunitiesJobs FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE PITTSBURGH, PA – On March 19, the Graffiti Squad charged Tylor O’Connell, 22, of Brentwood with 19 counts of criminal mischief for his graffiti tags painted throughout the City.

As members of the Pittsburgh community, we wanted to reach out to you ahead of this weekend's planned protests and ask for your help in keeping the peace. There has been much speculation as to who will show-up at this weekend's protests and what their intentions will be. We assure you that our officers and detectives are working to learn as much about these events as possible so we can do our best to protect our citizens and our city, but we need your help. As trusted community leaders, we are counting on you to help spread a message of peace to your community groups, churches, schools, and in the streets. We cannot and will not tolerate violence, and we do not want to be the next Charlottesville. To that end, We want to make sure each of you are aware of our obligation to our residents and visitors, as well as our philosophy when it comes to handling protests. First, we have a legal and ethical obligation to protect ALL protesters. White, black, Republican, Democrat, anti-police, pro-Trump, anti-Trump, pro-union, anti-union; it doesn't matter. As police officers, we are obligated to check our personal feelings at the door. We have one job to do: keep the peace and ensure everyone is afforded the opportunity to safely exercise their first amendment rights. On a personal level, we do not always agree with the opinions and beliefs of those we are sworn to protect, but as police officers, that simply doesn't matter. We will treat everybody in a fair and equitable manner. We cannot and will not pick sides. Second, We want to make sure that you are aware of our philosophy on peaceful protests, so everyone has a basic understanding of why we do what we do. In general, when we are called to a protest and it is peaceful, we protect all parties involved and help facilitate the event. We will not arrest protesters who are simply exercising their constitutional rights. As a general rule, we will not arrest participants if they are doing nothing more than blocking traffic. However, if and when an event turns violent or destructive, we will take action. We cannot allow participants to cause injury or destroy property. If and when this occurs, we will make arrests. In closing, We want to assure you that we are working to make this weekend's events run as smoothly as possible. There is a saying in policing that we \"Hope for the best, but plan for the worst.\" Having dedicated and respected community leaders such as yourselves out there encouraging peace and unity is key piece of that plan. Thank you all and stay safe.

Once the victim calls in with the number on the card, the money is gone and cannot be retrieved. This is the first report of this scam, but police are warning the public because such activities often come in waves. “We never call customers for payment with the threat of same-day termination of services,” a Duquesne Light spokesperson said. “If you feel you have been targeted by a scam artist, call us at 1-888-393-7100 to verify before making a payment.” Duquesne Light does not perform shutoffs on weekends, and does not ask customers to purchase any type of pre-paid cards. In the event a scammer come to your door: -- Always ask to see employee identification. -- Look for a company logo on the person’s uniform and vehicle. -- Call the utility company to verify the person’s identification. A legitimate worker won’t mind waiting while you verify their employment information. The utility company will be able to tell you whether the person is an employee and whether they’ve dispatched a service call to your home or neighborhood. -- If you suspect the person is an imposter, please contact local law enforcement.

It matches police who want to give back to the community with young people who are hungry to learn about a life in public service.\" Master Police Officer Mildred Jenkins works at the camps and said the program “highlights issues that, unfortunately, plague our communities with discussions regarding bullying, illegal drugs, violent gangs, and firearm safety. We also place an emphasis on understanding the importance of being a good citizen and the significance of obtaining an education.’ Fifty city youths are invited to attend each session. Session 1: July 9-13 at Duquesne University. Session 2: July 23-27 at the University of Pittsburgh. Session 3: July 30- August 3 at CCAC/Northside Campus. Session 4: August 6-10 at Chatham University. Each daily session runs from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Two meals, snacks, uniforms and transportation to and from the campsite is provided.

All six Pittsburgh Police Zones, Police Headquarters and Philips Rec Center in Carrick will be designated drop-off sites on Saturday, April 28 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. as part of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s 15th National Prescription Drug Take Back Day. “Opioid addiction starts at home,” said Pittsburgh Police Sgt. Rebecca Bassano. “Pills lead to heroin, but hopefully this curtails it a bit. The more we get out of your home, the better off we are.” The DEA holds two Drug Take Back events a year. More than 4,200 law enforcement partners participated in the previous event in October, and collected a record 912,305 pounds -- or 456 tons -- of unused or unwanted drugs. In Pittsburgh, police collected 391 pounds of drugs. Across the commonwealth, 211 agencies collected 36,909 pounds of drugs. Since the fall of 2010, the DEA and local police have collected and destroyed -- and therefore kept out of the hands of current or would-be addicts -- over 9 million pounds of unused prescription drugs. For those who cannot participate this weekend, permanent drop-off boxes are located at Pittsburgh Police Headquarters and Zone 6. “Don’t hold on to them,” Bassano said. “There’s always an opportunity to get rid of these drugs.” The National Prescription Drug Take Back Day aims to provide a safe, convenient, and responsible means of disposing prescription drugs, while educating the public about the potential for medication-abuse. According to the DEA: Rates of prescription drug abuse in the U.S. are alarmingly high, as are the number of accidental poisonings and overdoses. Studies show that a majority of abused prescription drugs are obtained from family and friends, including from the home medicine cabinet.

May 8, 2018 -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire will soon have two new ladder trucks in operation, both of which were custom-made to allow firefighters to more easily navigate the city’s narrow and winding roadways. Ladder Truck #14 will run out of Oakland; Ladder Truck #30 will be stationed in Elliott and help cover Ingram borough. The #14 truck will go into regular operations in mid-June and the #30 will start in late June. The addition of the ladder trucks means all 11 PBF front line trucks will meet the same unique Pittsburgh specifications. The ladder trucks were designed through a collaboration between Glick Fire Equipment Company, Inc. in Zelienople and a committee of Pittsburgh Fire officials, including one Battalion Chief, one Captain, two Lieutenants and one firefighter. They were made by Pierce Manufacturing Inc. of Appleton, Wisconsin. “They (the committee) wanted a lot of things for these trucks so they can be used on Pittsburgh’s roads,” said Jim Sims of Glick Fire Equipment Company, Inc. “They use the trucks every day so they know what they need and want.” The ladder trucks are 40 feet, 6.5 inches long, 11 feet, 10 inches high, and 96-inches wide. The standard width for ladder trucks in other cities is 101 inches, but the Pittsburgh trucks have several features that make them slimmer, including recessed grab rails and bar lights, and a recessed AC unit. The rear has been elevated and tapered to 88 inches, allowing drivers to more easily avoid obstacles on tight turns. “I’m very pleased,” said Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Assistant Chief Thomas Cook. “They meet our daily service needs, they’re durable and they hold up well in the city environment.” Each truck has a 525 horse-power engine, an attached 105-foot ladder and 182 feet of ground ladders. Rather than stainless steel, Glick used rubber for the fender crowns and rub railings, so that if the truck brushes against an object, the damage is lessened. The trucks cost $890,000 each are funded through the regular budget of the Equipment Leasing Authority (ELA).

The terrain was complex due to the tight space available and the extrication needed to get Mr. Tran into a medic unit,\" Meyer added. Because of the 45-degree angle of the hillside, EMS rescuers along with firefighters from Station 8 used ropes and a basket to get personnel safely down the hillside and place Mr. Tran into a medic unit.

Mr. Tran was placed inside and transported to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital for treatment. Zone 5 police officers assisted in the rescue while keeping traffic moving and keeping the area safe and secure. How did Mr. Tran end up on the hillside?

May 16, 2018 – The City of Pittsburgh's River Rescue patrol and Police Chief Scott Schubert found and cared for a lost gosling that climbed into a rescue boat on Tuesday. Paramedic Dave Naples found the gosling Tuesday night around 6:30 p.m. as crews were preparing to patrol the Ohio River during an outdoor concert by \"American Idol\" finalist Gabby Barrett at the Rivers Casino Amphitheater. Naples found the gosling, believed to be one- or two- weeks old, covered in debris and shaking in the transom well near the rear motors. Due to recent rainfall, the city's rivers are moving quickly and carrying debris, which results in challenging conditions for goslings. The River Rescue crew built a makeshift nest for the gosling by laying towels in a plastic bin. The gosling “cleaned itself off and was then full of vim and vigor,” Naples said. They named it Gabby because “if it weren’t for the concert, we might not have been patrolling and the gosling probably wouldn’t have made it,” Chief Schubert said. The crew called the Pennsylvania Game Commission, then cared for the gosling overnight. State Game Warden Thomas Kline took the gosling to the Humane Animal Rescue Wildlife Center in Verona around 12 p.m. Wednesday. Kline said anyone who finds a solo gosling should call the Game Commission at (724) 238-9523. River Rescue is a partnership between Pittsburgh Police and the Emergency Medical Services SCUBA search and rescue team.

To that end the City today is announcing three new initiatives on its responses to unpermitted demonstrations going forward. The City's guiding principle remains protecting the First Amendment rights of protesters while assuring that all people – from protesters to city residents and motorists who may be affected by road closures – are kept safe. Today the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is announcing new roadway safety guidelines; crisis intervention teams to work with protesters; and work on a new de-escalation initiative. Police are committed to allowing protestors to close streets during First Amendment activities, but to ensure safety the new Roadway Safety Guidelines prohibit demonstrations from blocking hospital, special event and tunnel/bridge entrances and exits. Using input from traffic and crowd management planners, it also bars certain critically important intersections from being closed down at any time, and other intersections from being closed down during morning and afternoon rush hours. \"These guidelines are a starting point, which give incident commanders more direction and balance when managing peaceful protests and ensure that public safety is maintained for all involved,\" Police Chief Scott Schubert said. The Road Safety Guidelines policy is available in full here. Police will soon deploy crisis intervention teams to coordinate with protesters during demonstrations and promote open communication between organizers and police personnel. The specially-trained officers will seek to meet with protesters both before and after events to address concerns or issues that arise, in order to keep protesters safe and informed of police actions in support of First Amendment activity. Police will also formally adopt de-escalation practices and tactics proven to reduce tension and enhance safety during demonstrations and other crowd activities. Public Safety personnel will work with community leaders and stakeholders to provide input into the policies before they are adopted.

PITTSBURGH, PA (Aug. 14, 2018) – Pittsburgh Emergency Medical Services Chief Robert Farrow marked the end of a distinguished career on Tuesday, his final day on the job before retiring. “I never aspired to be chief,” said Farrow, 61, of Stanton Heights. “Not that I was afraid of the job or didn’t feel I was prepared to do it, it was just something I never thought I’d do. I wasn’t growing up saying, ‘I want to be chief one day.’ It just kind of happened. “It’s been fun. I have no regrets. We have a really great bunch of people, not only in the office but out in the streets, which makes the job much easier. It’s a great dedication we have in EMS, with everybody doing what’s right for the mission.” Chief Farrow started working with Pittsburgh EMS on June 16, 1975. His institutional knowledge and his patient and nurturing leadership style will be missed, city officials said. \"Bob Farrow personifies public service,” Mayor William Peduto said. “He was the youngest medic on the job when he started in 1975, worked his way up the ranks, and held every position in the bureau. His amazing career mirrors the proud history of Pittsburgh's Emergency Medical Services corps.” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich once served under the leadership of Chief Farrow. Hissrich worked for EMS, as a Paramedic and Crew Chief, from 1985 to 1990 before starting a 25-year career with the FBI. He said Farrow was always calm in the face of chaos, and served as a mentor to countless first responders. “Chief Farrow was my one of my first immediate supervisors in my public safety career of 40 years,” Hissrich said. “He still ranks as one of my most-respected supervisors. His knowledge, fairness and calmness during times of chaos exemplifies leadership qualities that should be replicated by all in public safety. “You always remember the good ones and Bob was one of the best. That includes the FBI and (Pittsburgh) Public Safety. … He gets the job done and is well-respected. He will be a big loss.” Mayor Peduto has named Ronald Romano acting EMS Chief. Romano, 61, of Stanton Heights, started working for Pittsburgh EMS on March 27, 1978. The City of Pittsburgh thanks Chief Farrow for his four-plus decades of exemplary service. This is a test.

Rather, it appears the driver might have been trying to show off in the car and somehow lost control of the vehicle. The driver had a learner’s permit and should not have not have been operating the vehicle without an adult passenger. The passenger in the vehicle yesterday was not an adult. No charges have been filed at this time. Police are continuing to investigate. Fortunately, none of the students’ injuries were life-threatening. But this could have been far worse, which is why Public Safety every year reminds motorists to drive carefully, especially in school zones. At the beginning of this school year, Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officers conducted a School Bus Stop and Zone Blitz, during which officers actively sought and ticketed motorists who passed a school bus with its red lights activated or who sped in school zones. Officers continue to actively police those zones. This incident was a reminder that motor vehicles are not toys. They should always be operated legally and with great care. And we all need to be particularly vigilant in school zones. It's true that this incident could have been far worse, but it never should have happened at all. For that reason, we urge everyone to please drive safely.

PITTSBURGH, PA (Nov. 8, 2018) – It is with heavy hearts that Pittsburgh residents and Public Safety officials learn of the latest mass shooting in our country, this one in Thousand Oaks, California. Just 10 days ago, we too suffered a senseless tragedy when a man driven by hate entered a Squirrel Hill synagogue and opened fire: First on peaceful worshipers of the Tree of Life, New Light and Dor Hadash congregations, and then on our Pittsburgh Police officers who ran towards gunfire to save the innocent. We understand all too well the immense anguish that the victims’ families and first responders now must endure, and we send our deepest condolences. We will be reaching out to the leaders of the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office – who lost a sheriff’s deputy when he courageously and selflessly ran into the building with the singular goal of saving lives – to offer our sympathy and any assistance they may require. “The nightmare that descended upon Pittsburgh on an otherwise peaceful morning has now visited the community of Thousand Oaks and Ventura County,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “No community should have to experience such a horrific tragedy. Unfortunately, these mass casualty events are becoming all too common.” In the days to come, the names of the victims will be released and the sorrow will only intensify as we learn details of who they were and the potential we have lost. We know this all too well. For that reason and others, the City of Pittsburgh today stands with Thousand Oaks and with all communities affected by these senseless killings. And we remember and celebrate Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Helus, who died a hero. \"On behalf of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, we want to express our most heartfelt thoughts and prayers to the innocent victims and all who were impacted by the horrific and senseless violence in Thousand Oaks,\" Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert said. \"Pittsburgh stands strong with the City of Thousand Oaks and the Ventura County Sheriff's Office.

(Hooten) (Rini) (Wallace) FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE PITTSBURGH, PA (November 16, 2018) - Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Homicide Detectives have arrested 18-year-old Tarue Davis in connection with a fatal shooting at a convenience store in Knoxville. Tarue Davis now faces criminal homicide charges in connection with the death of 23-year-old James Loughlin. Mr. Laughlin was shot on November 2, 2018 at the Unimart Convenience store located in the 700 block of Brownsville Road. Tarue Davis was arrested at his residence shortly before 2 p.m. today, November, 16, 2018. He is now in the Allegheny County Jail. TARUE DAVIS FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE PITTSBURGH, PA (November 17, 2018) -- At approximately 5:10 p.m. on Saturday, November 17, 2018 City of Pittsburgh Public Safety Personnel responded to a two-alarm fire at the Ebenezer Towers, located in the 400 block of Dinwiddie Street. Police, Fire, and EMS arrived on the scene and immediately began fighting the fire and evacuating residents from the building. One person was rescued from a second floor balcony. Meanwhile, Paramedics began assisting and evaluating residents on the scene. An 85-year-old woman suffered burns to her foot and was transported to the hospital in stable condition. A male resident was transported to the hospital for evaluation due to a pre-existing condition. He has since been released from the hospital. To provide immediate shelter for the elderly and those suffering from illnesses, Zone 2 officers escorted and assisted residents to their police station. Most of those residents are now with family members or back inside their apartments. Firefighters were quickly able to contain the fire to two apartments. Fire Chief Darryl Jones says, “Thankfully, this ten-story building had a working sprinkler system.” The sprinkler system was very instrumental in saving lives and preventing further damage to the high rise. Ebenezer Towers has ten floors and ninety-nine occupied apartments. The majority of the residents are seniors and many suffer from medical conditions. Residents on the upper floors were permitted back into their apartments after the building was deemed safe. The twenty-four people who lived on the first two floors were displaced primarily due to heavy smoke and water damage. The American Red Cross is currently assisting residents who could not return to their home. In addition to the collaborative efforts of Public Safety personnel, Port Authority Transit and The Center for Family Excellence provided temporary shelter so evacuated residents did not have to brave the cold temperatures. The Salvation Army along with volunteers from the Center assisted residents and First Responders by providing food and beverages. During the evacuation, medics secured needed medications for those in need. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. PITTSBURGH, PA (Nov. 19, 2018) – The Washington Boulevard floodgates are temporarily inoperable after a vehicle crash on Friday left its operations system damaged. The crash occurred around 7:35 p.m. Friday near the intersection of Washington and Allegheny River boulevards. A vehicle struck a pole that housed the master operations system, causing significant damage. The vehicle rolled, and the female driver, who was temporarily trapped inside her SUV, was transported to a local hospital in stable condition. The City's Chief Operations Officer, Guy Costa, said the system will be down until replacement parts can be ordered. There is no timeline for repairs. Until the floodgates are operational, Zone 5 Police officers will manually set up barriers to prevent vehicles from entering the flood-prone area during times of heavy rain. Zone 5 officers are well-trained in this exercise as they have used this plan in recent months when the system was previously inoperable. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich reminds motorists to never drive through standing water and to never drive around barricades. Multiple vehicles have been spotted driving around the floodgates in recent months, in some cases even when police cruisers with activated flashers were on scene. For your safety and for the safety of others, do not drive around barricades or through standing water.

(Dinkins) PITTSBURGH, PA (Dec. 3, 2018) -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, in collaboration with the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh and the Buhl Foundation’s One Northside Initiative, invite residents and the media to the grand opening of the Northview Heights Public Safety Center at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, Dec. 4. The new Public Safety Center -- which will serve residents of Northview Heights and Allegheny Dwellings -- is designed to improve quality of life for residents and to strengthen relationships between the community and the officers who serve them. Tomorrow’s Open House event will provide the public with a first glimpse inside the facility -- where residents will have access to job training, arts programs, and shared community space -- plus an opportunity to hear from City officials, community leaders and Northview Heights residents on their hopes for the Safety Center. “This center is a great model of many different partners coming together for a common good, one that delivers equity and quality of life for all,” Mayor William Peduto said. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich credited the many partners who came together on this project, including the Housing Authority and Executive Director Caster D. Binion. “We worked closely on this important project, one which will result in improved police-community relations, more opportunities for residents and a safer environment for all,” Hissrich said. “We have seen great success with the opening of the Downtown substation, and we expect to replicate that success with the Northview Heights Public Safety Center.” “We fully understand the value of working hand-in-hand with residents to build a better and safer community through collaboration, mutual respect and trust,” Police Chief Scott Schubert added. “This partnership in Northview Heights has the ability to make a significant difference in community-police relations, reduction of crime and disorder, and shared success in overall community wellness. It's our goal to replicate these partnerships and success stories in other communities.” This Safety Center is in large part the result of the dedication and hard work of the Buhl Foundation, which decided several years ago to invest in Pittsburgh’s Northside neighborhoods. Through a series of surveys, public meetings, and face-to-face meetings with residents, Buhl and their partners asked the public how they would change and improve their neighborhoods. In doing so, they identified several common themes, which became the pillars of their One Northside Initiative: Place, Employment, Health, Education, and Safety. “Both Northside residents and Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Officers indicated a desire to build safer communities by working together,” said Buhl Foundation President Diana Bucco. “I congratulate the City of Pittsburgh Housing Authority, Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and the Mayor’s Office for coming together in response to this need, and creating a space that is responsive to the community and a demonstration model that will truly have national implications.” The new Safety Center was made possible through a substantial investment of Housing Authority dollars to create the state-of-the-art facility to focus on resident engagement and pro-active community safety. \"The Public Safety Center is a welcome addition to the Northview Heights community,\" said HACP Executive Director Caster D. Binion. \"We are proud to partner with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, the Buhl Foundation and everyone who came together to develop a plan that puts resident safety and quality of life as the utmost priority. We expect the endeavor to produce an immediate, positive impact on the lives of the hundreds of Pittsburgh senior citizens and families who call Northview Heights home.\" SPEAKERS (In order of appearance): PBP Zone 1 Commander Christopher Ragland Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich Housing Authority Executive Director Caster Binion PBP Chief Scott Schubert The Buhl Foundation’s Amber Farr PBP Sergeant Joseph Lewis Tenant Council President Marcus Reed Northview Heights Residents Olivia Bennett and Siraji Hassan.

Pleasant Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15214 PITTSBURGH, PA (Dec. 3, 2018) – The Pittsburgh Steelers will present Police Chief Scott Schubert with a check tomorrow for the purchase of a Community Relations Trailer. Steelers’ All-Pro Center Maurkice Pouncey and others from the Steelers organization will be at the grand opening of the Northview Heights Public Safety Center on Tuesday, Dec. 4 at 11:30 a.m. to personally hand Chief Schubert a check to purchase the trailer, which will be used at events around the city starting in the spring. “Being able to work with Maurkice and other Steelers players and our officers and give back to the community is a special thing for us,” Chief Schubert said. “The fact the players and the organization give back to the community is awesome. It’s what Pittsburgh is about.” The vision for a Community Relations Trailer came about in October, 2017, when Chief Schubert first discussed the idea of partnering with the Steelers to establish a vehicle that could attend community events, provide entertainment and education for residents, and even be used for recruitment purposes. The Steelers shared Chief Schubert’s vision and PBP officials were put in contact with Ready-2-Roll trailers of Peachtree, Georgia. Together, they designed a proposal for the trailer. Features of the double-axle trailer, which will be 8 feet wide, 17 feet long and 7 feet tall, include: Propane grill, sound system, stereo system, video game systems, coolers, recliners, generator, storage space for games, handouts and food, flag pole holder, 13-foot awning, TV mount and 55-inch TV screen, exterior lights, and a black aluminum exterior. The exterior will be wrapped with a banner featuring images of the Steelers and Pittsburgh Police. The project is expected to cost $25,370. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is grateful for our partnership and continued engagement with the Pittsburgh Steelers. That partnership includes the Steelers giving tickets to dozens of local children to attend games with police officers, players helping feed hungry families on Thanksgiving, and players going on ride-alongs with police to gain a better understanding of our communities. The Community Relations Trailer will symbolize our ongoing partnership. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police thanks the entire Steelers organization for their commitment to the City of Pittsburgh and its residents. All are invited to attend. Chief Schubert and others will be available for media interviews.

PITTSBURGH, PA (Dec. 7, 2018) -- Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Officers arrested a wanted felon on multiple drug and gun charges on Dec. 6, 2018. Zone 5 plainclothes officers observed a vehicle fail to stop at a stop sign at the intersection of Lemington Avenue and Oberlin Street around 7:41 p.m. on Thursday. The officers turned on the flashers on their unmarked police vehicle and observed the driver -- later identified as Tyrek Jrevae Booker, 40 -- appear to reach towards the driver’s side floorboard. The vehicle stopped on Gladefield Street next to Chadwick Park. A traffic stop was conducted. Booker was compliant and detained without incident. Officers placed Booker under arrest when they smelled marijuana in the car and observed partially burned marijuana cigarettes in the ashtray and center console container. A further inspection of the vehicle revealed: Multiple bags of crack-cocaine, a bag of suspected powder cocaine, a jar with marijuana and individual bags of marijuana, bottles containing an unknown purple liquid, a black digital scale with white residue, and multiple bullets. Asked if there was a gun in the vehicle, Booker acknowledged that a firearm was under the driver’s seat. Police recovered a black handgun. Officers also recovered multiple burnt marijuana cigars and multiple individual bags of crack-cocaine from Booker’s pockets. Officers then discovered that Booker did not have a concealed carry permit and that he had an active warrant. Booker was transported to the Allegheny County Jail and booked on multiple counts of Possession of a Controlled Substance, multiple counts of Possession with Intent to Deliver Controlled Substances, and gun charges. Booker also goes by the name of Tyree. He has previous arrests under Tyrek and Tyree. In 1996, Booker was convicted of voluntary manslaughter in the shooting death of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Sgt. James “Rip\" Taylor during an argument outside Taylor’s home. (Booker) PITTSBURGH, PA (Dec. 9, 2018) -- The Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police are aware of and are investigating the dissemination of anti-Semitic pamphlets in Pittsburgh neighborhoods, including Squirrel Hill. Such hate-filled material will not be tolerated in Pittsburgh -- not by residents, City officials nor Law Enforcement. The Department of Public Safety -- including Director Wendell Hissrich, Police Chief Scott Schubert and Zone 4 Commander Dan Herrmann -- assures the community that we are taking this matter very seriously and will follow every investigative avenue. Pittsburgh is and will remain Stronger than Hate. PITTSBURGH, PA (Dec. 11, 2018) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police today will place “Stronger than Hate” decals on police vehicles in Zone 4. The decals are in response to the Oct. 27 tragedy in Squirrel Hill in which members of the Tree of Life, New Light and Dor Hadash congregations were attacked while peacefully worshipping. \"This is an ongoing effort to show our commitment to the communities we serve,” said Commander Eric Holmes. “Our ranks include members of the Bureau who are of the Jewish faith and this is also a way to support them. “Pittsburgh has a storied history that includes the Steel industry, the Steelers, and since 1857 the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police,” Holmes continued. “Hate is NOT part of our DNA. Placing these decals on our vehicles in Zone 4 is a small way to reflect on our shared history and to show that we stand together as one.\" Four Pittsburgh Police officers were shot and injured while responding to the synagogue shooting and two others were injured. The Bureau has been overwhelmed with residents’ support for the officers who responded, and for Zone 4. “We are grateful for the outpouring of love and support from across America, the City of Pittsburgh, and in particular, the residents of the Squirrel Hill neighborhood,” Zone 4 Commander Dan Herrmann said. “The men and women from the Zone 4 police station, who serve the Squirrel Hill community, are proud to display the decals on our police vehicles.” The decals, which were designed in conjunction with the Pittsburgh Steelers, will remain on cars through January. PITTSBURGH, PA (Dec. 12, 2018) -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police held its inaugural Years of Service recognition ceremony today at Point Park University.

Congratulations to all on reaching a significant milestone. PITTSBURGH, PA (Dec. 17, 2018) - On Dec. 18, 2018, at 7:30 p.m., the City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will conduct a live-fire test of the ShotSpotter gunshot detection service, which was recently expanded to an 18-square mile coverage area. Tests will occur in the following neighborhoods: Bedford Dwellings, Beltzhoover, Hazelwood, Homewood, Marshall-Shadeland, Perry, West End and Upper Hill. The purpose of the test is to verify all systems are operating as expected and guide any final adjustments before activating the service. The ShotSpotter service is not considered live and operational until the successful completion of the live-fire test. Pittsburgh Police will be onsite at all test locations to ensure conditions for testing are safe. The controlled tests will consist of a sequence of gunshots fired at close range into a bullet trap. No bullets will be fired into the air and there is no danger to the public. ShotSpotter uses a wide-area network of acoustic sensors to detect when a gun is fired, and then precisely and quickly pinpoints the location of the gunfire. In less than a minute, police officers and 911 dispatchers are notified of the fully-qualified and validated gunfire incidents, even if no one calls 911 – although the community is always encouraged to report sounds of gunfire. By quickly notifying first responders of gunfire, ShotSpotter helps speed that response with precise information in order to save lives – much like a fire alarm. ShotSpotter is one of several cutting-edge technologies the City of Pittsburgh is employing to ensure the safety and security of our residents, visitors and surrounding communities. “There are areas within the city that gunfire is so frequent and people don’t call 911,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “With ShotSpotter we have that instant alert to the police officers. They show up. They find individuals who have been injured. They may render first aid right away until the medics arrive, and we have saved lives.” “Sometimes you’ll get a call that there’s shots fired, but you don’t know where it’s at in that area,” Police Chief Scott Schubert said. “Now it’s more specific where it’s at, how many rounds are being fired and, tactically for the officer approaching the scene, it’s safer.” FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE PITTSBURGH, PA (December 18, 2018) -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police hosted a discussion of Ethnic Intimidation during the meeting of the FBI Greater Pittsburgh Civil Rights Working Group today. Pittsburgh Police Commander Eric Holmes serves as the Police Bureau’s liaison to the group and partnered with FBI Supervisory Special Agent Greg Heeb to coordinate this timely discussion. The Pittsburgh Police Crime Analysis Unit led by Dr. Heath Johnson, Crime Analyst Coordinator, released statistics and analysis on Ethnic Intimidation in the City of Pittsburgh. Community leaders and representatives from the Greater Pittsburgh area received a ten-year analysis of Ethnic Intimidation incidents within the City of Pittsburgh. The Pennsylvania Crimes Code does not have specific “Hate Crime” charges but the term Ethnic Intimidation is used synonymously with the term Hate Crime. The FBI defines Hate Crimes as “a criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender’s bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity.” Under the Pennsylvania Ethnic Intimidation Crimes Code, sexual orientation is not covered. However; the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police tracks incidents involving sexual orientation. Over a ten-year period, the City of Pittsburgh averaged 19 incidents per year and an average of eight violent Ethnic Intimidation incidents per year. The annual counts of incidents have remained steady over this ten-year period and are nearly evenly distributed throughout the neighborhoods. City of Pittsburgh Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich said, “It is important for our residents to report potential crimes involving ethnic intimidation. The City of Pittsburgh Public Safety Department and Pittsburgh Bureau of Police take these reports very seriously because we want all residents to enjoy the quality of life that this city has to offer. Police will do everything possible to ensure those reporting incidents will be safe and protected.” The arrest rates for Ethnic Intimidation incidents average 40% with nearly 60% for violent incidents. Other Key Findings: * From January 1, 2008 to October 28, 2018 the distribution of Ethnic Intimidation Incidents are as follows: 76% of the incidents involved Race, 9% involved Ethnicity, 8% involved Religion, 6% involved Sexual Orientation, and 1% involved Disability. * Racial animus is the most common contributor to Ethnic Intimidation charges, with the vast majority of those targeting African Americans. “Any type of bias or Hate Crime is unacceptable and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is committed to thoroughly investigating and prosecuting anyone who violates the law. No one should ever have to live in a state of fear because of their race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability,” Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert stated. What can be done in the future to reduce the number of Ethnic Intimidation incidents in our area? To answer that question, today’s presenters shared current resources and discussed these key areas: * The need to educate Law Enforcement and the community on recognizing Ethnic Intimidation. * The need for more residents to report incidents of Ethnic Intimidation. If residents see an incident, report the incident. * Enhance the public’s awareness of the issue and inform residents of the incidents. * Enhance community involvement with awareness and education programs. Police Chief Schubert added, “It is our hope that by continually sharing data with the public, we can draw more attention to the problem and work with the community to ensure violations are reported and investigated. By working together, we can prevent future occurrences of bias and hate. We owe it to everyone who lives, works or visits our beautiful city.” Pittsburgh is STRONGER THAN HATE For more: Facebook.com/PittsburghPolice FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE PITTSBURGH, PA (December 27, 2018) -- Pittsburgh Bureau of Police detectives are warning residents of a telephone scam where callers say they are from the Duquesne Light Company and threaten to immediately terminate your services. A Duquesne Light Company phone number has been imitated by scam artists who are calling customers and telling them they owe money. The scammers will then tell the customer to go out and buy gift cards or pre-paid cards to pay off the balance or their power will be shut off. This is a scam and Pittsburgh residents should be vigilant when receiving these type of calls. “While this is a common scam, the callers are getting more savvy in their approach. Residents need to know that Duquesne Light would never call you and threaten termination that same day. There is a process for terminations,” said Jessica Rock, Duquesne Light spokeswoman. Here are a few things you should know to protect yourself against these telephone scams: For more on how to protect yourself from scammers posing as Duquesne Light workers, visit the company’s website at https://www.duquesnelight.com/customer-support/avoid-scams . PITTSBURGH, PA (Dec. 30, 2018) – The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust will host First Night events Monday, Dec. 31, at venues throughout the Golden Triangle. As is the case every year, the celebration will bring large crowds throughout the Downtown area. Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich welcomes the holiday season revelers, and urges everyone to be safe, respectful and law-abiding. “First Night is a Pittsburgh tradition and Public Safety will be there to assure a safe experience for all,” Hissrich said. “We ask that people behave responsibly and safely. As with other large events Downtown and elsewhere in the city, there will be a significant police presence to maintain safety.” New Year’s Eve is traditionally a time when people celebrate with alcohol. Public Safety urges people not to drink and drive. Police will be actively looking for impaired drivers and arresting those who break the law. Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will work with partnering law enforcement agencies -- including the Pennsylvania State Police, State Park Rangers, Port Authority Police and the Allegheny County Police -- to provide uniformed and plainclothes officers throughout the venues. The Mounted Unit also will be on hand. Public Safety reminds the public that drones are not allowed, nor are illegal weapons. City law prohibits the use of any fireworks, even those that are legal, within 150 feet of a structure. The weather forecast calls for mild temperatures, but rain during the day. Please dress appropriately. In addition, Public Safety reminds residents that celebratory gunfire remains a significant problem in many cities, particularly on New Year’s Eve. Sadly, the results are often tragic when innocent people are hit by the bullets. Any bullet discharged from a gun, even into the sky, must land somewhere, and when it does, there is significant risk of injury or death. Pittsburgh Public Safety is committed to a policy of zero tolerance of illegal gun use. Our mission is to protect the quality of life for all residents throughout our community by creating an environment of enhanced safety and security. Officers will respond to all ShotSpotter activations throughout the city and will arrest anyone caught discharging a firearm in public. As normal, officers will be deployed throughout the city to maintain the peace, prevent crime and violence, and arrest drunk drivers. Pittsburgh Public Safety utilizes the ShotSpotter gunfire alerts and analysis solution to detect and locate gunfire incidents and gather gunfire intelligence and data to fight crime and violence. ShotSpotter provides precision-policing solutions for law enforcement to help deter gun violence and make cities, campuses and facilities safer. ShotSpotter is used in more than 90 cities. ShotSpotter uses a wide-area network of acoustic sensors to detect when a gun is fired, and then precisely and quickly pinpoints the location of the gunfire. ShotSpotter is one of several cutting-edge technologies the City of Pittsburgh employs to ensure the safety and security of our residents and officers. “Sometimes you’ll get a call that there’s shots fired, but you don’t know where it’s at in that area,” Police Chief Scott Schubert said. “Now it’s more specific where it’s at, how many rounds are being fired and, tactically for the officer approaching the scene, it’s safer.” For more information on First Night celebrations, go to firstnightpgh.trustarts.org. PITTSBURGH, PA (Jan. 5, 2019) -- Multiple Public Safety departments, including Pittsburgh Fire, Police, EMS and Animal Care and Control, responded to a one-alarm fire on the 1800 block of Lowrie Street in Troy Hill Saturday morning around 9 a.m. Firefighters put out the flames quickly, but the residence, a two-story duplex at the intersection of Lowrie and Lofink Street, sustained significant fire and smoke damage.

The Fire Investigation Unit, made up of investigators from the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire and detectives from the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, are investigating the cause of the fire. Great teamwork by multiple Public Safety departments assured the safety of all involved. PITTSBURGH, PA (Jan. 14, 2019) -- City, Public Safety and Police Bureau officials gathered this morning in the Mayor’s Conference Room to discuss the final 2018 statistics for homicides, investigation clearance rates and shootings. Over the past several years, homicides and shootings have trended downwards in the city of Pittsburgh. That trend continued in 2018. But officials warned that although the numbers represent progress, work remains. \"Every year since 2014, we have seen a decrease in the number of homicides that have occurred in this city. That includes last year,\" Mayor William Peduto said. \"Our clearance rate has also increased, dramatically, and that is completely due to the work of Police. ... However, that’s still not good enough. Our goal is to eradicate gun violence in our city.” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich credited the improving numbers on increased community engagement, the use of technology including security cameras and ShotSpotter, and the hard work of police officers, among other factors. “Some of the accomplishments have to do with the staffing of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police,” Director Hissrich said. “Thanks to the Mayor and City Council, our staffing levels have increased dramatically over the last several years allowing more officers to be on the street. (When) the public sees the same officers day to day, we have more of an open dialogue. Without the community, these numbers would be drastically higher. Next year we hope to see the continued downward trend of these numbers. But that will only be done through the help of the community, technology and most importantly the work of Pittsburgh Police.” There were 71 homicides in 2014. The total dropped to 60 in 2015, 59 in 2016, 58 in 2017 and 55 in 2018. There were 174 non-fatal shootings in 2015, when Police began creating the Group Violence Intervention (GVI) Unit, which targets at-risk members of the community and offers guidance and services to escape a life of violence and crime. The number rose to 188 in 2016, then dropped to 140 in 2017 and 114 in 2018. Clearance rates hovered in the 50-percent range from 2014 to 2017, but improved to 71 percent in 2018. Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Chief Scott Schubert praised his officers, who take every homicide personally. He also credited residents for their willingness to work with Police, and said officers would continue to focus on removing illegal firearms from the streets. “One homicide is too many in the city of Pittsburgh, and we need to think about the victims’ families and what they go through when someone is murdered,” Schubert said. “Our job is not done. We still have a lot to do. But I’m very, very proud of the work of the Pittsburgh Police, day in and day out.” Chief Schubert added: “If we could go through a year without having any homicides, I’d be the happiest man in the world because it would mean families are not grieving.” PITTSBURGH, PA (Jan. 7, 2019) -- The Western Pennsylvania Fugitive Task Force arrested Tremayne Wilmer, 47, of Verona today on a charge of Criminal Homicide in the 2017 shooting death of Augustus Gray, 14.

The ceremony was held today, Tuesday, at 1:00 p.m. in the Mayor’s Office Conference Room. Mayor William Peduto joined the Police Command staff in congratulating Fisher on his accomplishments and recognizing his exemplary career with the department. “Thank you for your commitment to the Police Department and thank you to your family for their future commitment in your new position,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said.

PITTSBURGH, PA (Feb. 4, 2019) -- On Oct. 4, 2018 at approximately 10:24 p.m., Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officers were dispatched to Brottier Hall on the 700 block of Forbes Avenue to assist Duquesne University Police for a report of a male who had jumped from the 16th floor. PBP officers observed an unconscious male on the ground outside the building. Pittsburgh EMS transported the male to UPMC Mercy. He was pronounced dead at the hospital at 11:12 p.m. The victim was identified as Duquesne University student Marquis Jaylen Brown, 21, of Washington, D.C. Pittsburgh Police took over the investigation because it involved the death of a student. According to the investigation: Brown visited a friend’s off-campus apartment on the night of his death. He returned to his dorm/apartment on the 16th floor of Brottier Hall around 10 p.m. According to surveillance video and multiple witness statements, Brown acted erratically in the elevator, in the 16th floor dorm hallway, and in his dorm room. As a result of his behavior, students called 911. Duquesne University Police and campus security officers responded at 10:05 p.m. The officers entered Brown’s apartment minutes later and spoke to him and his roommate. The initial call was for a possible fight between roommates, but officers determined that there was no fight, and that the roommate was trying to calm Brown. Soon after the officers’ arrival, Brown picked up a chair and broke a window. Eye witnesses in the room -- including two Duquesne University Police officers, a campus security guard and a student Resident Assistant -- stated that Brown then jumped out the window. Brown’s roommate, who was in another room, was an audible witness. Duquesne University Police called EMS and went outsider to render aid. Pittsburgh Police were then called to the scene. Drug testing shows that Brown had marijuana in his system. Witnesses stated that there was no physical contact or confrontation between police and Brown in the room. The case is closed pending any additional evidence. PITTSBURGH, PA (Feb. 20, 2019) -- On Wednesday, Feb. 28, 2018 Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officers responded to the 5400 block of Black Street for a report of skeletal remains in the rear of a residence. Responding officers learned that the home had recently changed ownership and the new owners were doing construction in the yard. Workers digging in the yard discovered the remains and called police. The remains were buried under a slab of concrete and assorted brick. The remains and other evidence, including clothing, were recovered by Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office Investigators and detectives from the Pittsburgh Police Crime Scene Unit. The remains were transported to the Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office. An investigation began, led by Detective Edward Fallert. The remains appeared to have been buried in the yard for a significant amount of time. Detectives checked Missing Persons reports and found no matches. Det. Fallert conferred with retired Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Assistant Chief Therese Rocco, who had headed the bureau’s Missing Person’s Division for many years before her retirement in 1994. Assistant Chief Rocco was unable to identify the victim from police reports. However, while reviewing former owners and occupants of the residence, Rocco remembered Mary and Albert Arcuri, who were Rocco’s former neighbors and friends more than 50 years ago. She recalled that in the mid-1960s, the story was that Mary had left Albert and was never seen or heard from again. No Missing Person report was filed and police were not notified. Through further investigation, detectives learned that Albert and Mary Arcuri purchased the residence in the early 1960s, and that in the fall of 1964, Albert told family members that Mary had left him. He stated that Mary had taken her clothing and personal items and left. Less than a year later (May, 1965), Albert Arcuri died when the car he was driving crashed into a building on Baum Boulevard, which was then the Don Allen Chevrolet car dealership. Investigators obtained a DNA sample from a living family member. The remains and the sample were sent to UNT Center for Human Identification in Texas for analysis. A forensic analyst from the lab last week confirmed that the remains are those of Mary Arcuri. The investigation is ongoing. At this time, no charges have been filed and Police cannot speculate on how Mary Arcuri died or why she was buried in the back yard. Anyone with information on this case is asked to call Pittsburgh Police at (412) 323-7161. Note: Surviving family have expressed their desire to not be contacted by media regarding this case. PITTSBURGH, PA (March 5, 2019) - The City of Pittsburgh Public Safety Department and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police announce the opening session of the Spring 2019 Student Police Academy on Wednesday, March 6th. This is the largest Student Police Academy class ever held with 34-registered participants.The program is open to high school students. For ten consecutive weeks, they will learn and observe various police operations and law enforcement tools used within the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.

The program focuses on education and awareness so students have an opportunity to understand laws, policies, and the critical decision-making process that police follow when responding to any public safety situation. This program of exclusive engagement with police is an extension of community outreach that strives to satisfy the general interests of our youth and those who may be considering a career in law enforcement of criminal justice. PITTSBURGH, PA (March 12, 2019) -- The City of Pittsburgh’s Public Safety Department has made preparations for the St. Patrick’s Day parade and celebrations Saturday, March 16. To help commemorate the celebration, Pittsburgh Bureau of Police vehicles in Zone 2, which includes Downtown, will display special St Patrick’s Day decals. (A photo of the decal can be found below.) Police and Public Safety want city residents and visitors to celebrate safely and responsibly. As such, please be aware of several items associated with the celebration. Road Closures: To accommodate the annual St. Patrick’s Day Parade, several roads will be closed Downtown starting at 7:30 a.m. along the parade route, which includes Liberty Avenue, Grant Street, the Boulevard of the Allies and Stanwix Street. The parade will form on Liberty Avenue from 11th to 26th streets. Streets will reopen at approximately 1 p.m. Market Square: The Irish Society for Education & Charity, Inc., which organizes the parade, will host a family-friendly celebration in Market Square from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. Note: Open containers of alcohol will not be permitted. Businesses on the square will serve alcohol as usual, but patrons cannot leave the businesses and/or patios with drinks.

Plan ahead, take advantage of discounted Lyft, Uber and Z-Trip fares, and never drive while under the influence or get in a vehicle with a driver who is intoxicated. DUI patrols will be actively looking for you if you do. Pedestrian Safety: Wear light-colored clothing so motorists can see you. Don’t wear headphones while walking. Every year when clocks change, vehicle vs. pedestrian crashes increase. Be aware. “Please remember there will be zero tolerance for disruptive and illegal behavior,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “Liquor Control Enforcement agents will be undercover to assure that bars and restaurants don’t serve alcohol to those under 21. Underage drinking, fake ID’s, alcohol poisoning, DUIs, falls from roofs and balconies are some of the illegal and dangerous behavior we’ve seen on St. Patrick’s Day. We want everyone to enjoy the celebrations, but to do so in a safe and responsible manner.” State Police, County Police, the Mounted Unit, police agencies from local universities and other public safety partners will be out in full force to prevent and stop illegal activities, and will cite or arrest those who violate laws. The City of Pittsburgh’s Public Safety Department wishes all a happy and safe St. Patrick’s Day. PITTSBURGH, PA (March 13, 2019) -- In preparation of the upcoming trial of former East Pittsburgh Officer Michael Rosfeld, Public Safety will implement road restrictions around the perimeter of the Allegheny County Courthouse starting on Tuesday, March 19. These road restrictions and closures will be in place while court is in session and should not create problems for the morning rush hour. However, they will result in delays at other times. A detour for motorists can be found here. Sidewalks around the courthouse will remain open. In light of demonstrations held in the summer of 2018 in the City, Public Safety issued protest guidelines designed to maintain safety for everyone who resides in, works in or visits Pittsburgh. Those guidelines were posted in June, and are posted again here with updates to include additional “red zones,” including the Busways. Additional rolling road closures might occur in the event of public demonstrations. The City of Pittsburgh’s Public Safety Department and several partnering law enforcement agencies have prepared for the upcoming trial and always strive to keep everyone safe. Throughout trial preparations, Community Outreach and members of the Mayor’s Office conferred with members of the public to assure a continuing line of communication. Out of respect for the legal process and in order to maintain the integrity of the trial, Public Safety officials will offer no further comment at this time on the trial or Public Safety’s preparations. PITTSBURGH, PA (March 15, 2019) -- The City of Pittsburgh learned of the events Friday in New Zealand with heavy hearts and an all-too-intimate understanding of what the people of New Zealand are enduring. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police's Intel Unit monitors all threats to all city residents and visitors, and works closely with law enforcement agencies at local, state and federal levels. Those efforts continue today, as always. Public Safety officials have been in contact with local Islamic leaders and have increased patrols at mosques and other locales. The City of Pittsburgh will protect all houses of worship and the right to freely and safely practice your religion without fear. As Mayor William Peduto noted following the tragic events of Oct. 27, 2018 in the Tree of Life Synagogue, Pittsburgh got its asterisk that day. We were added to the long list of communities who have suffered unimaginable loss as the result of ignorance and extremism. Today we stand with the people of Christchurch, New Zealand. We offer our deepest condolences. And we will continue to stand united against all forms of hate. PITTSBURGH, PA (March. 22, 2019) -- While preparing for the end of the Michael Rosfeld trial, the focus and singular goal of the City of Pittsburgh's Public Safety Department was to keep the city safe.

We know from experience that when Pittsburgh experiences hardships, we come together as a community. Public Safety's mission is and always will be to keep everyone safe. test PITTSBURGH, PA (April 2, 2019) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police welcomed 28 new officers Tuesday evening during a Training Academy Graduation Ceremony for recruit class BR 18-02. The class of 28 graduates began their training in August. They will spend the next four months in field training, during which they will be partnered with experienced officers for further training. Mayor William Peduto, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich and Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert were among those to congratulate the officers during a ceremony at the Community College of Allegheny County’s Foerster Student Center. “You have the responsibility to watch out for one another; you have the responsibility to make sure that your fellow officers are safe,” Mayor Peduto said. “You have a responsibility to represent the people of Pittsburgh and work with them. ... You will be there with people as they suffer the loss of loved ones, and they will look to you for comfort.” The class includes five females, an Iraqi native and a native of India. “You will become representatives of this city,\" Director Hissrich said. \"Your mission is to become role models to the young children and the foundation of our communities.\" Chief Schubert welcomed the officers to the Pittsburgh Police family. “One of the most amazing things about being in law-enforcement is the family in blue who gladly accepts us with open arms and understands who we are and what we go through,” Chief Schubert said. “I encourage you to have an open mind and to learn from everyone. They all have vast experience and will ease you into your new role as a servant and guardian.” PITTSBURGH, PA (April 9, 2020) - The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police has received confirmation that three additional personnel have tested positive for COVID-19.

I am proud to work alongside all of you. I am proud that, because of my parents, the word ‘can’t’ has never been in my DNA. I pray that my children see the limitless future that awaits them and they too will believe ‘can’t’ is not in their DNA.” (Deputy Chief Amera Gilchrist) Mayor Peduto said the ceremony signified “a transitional day” in Pittsburgh. “Not only are we seeing new equipment that is being procured by the city, not only are we seeing changes that are occurring within the work day and manning of power, but we‘re seeing a change in leadership, a generational change of leaders that are coming on board now and officially being sworn in today,” he said. Hissrich praised the hard work of all EMS officials. He noted that in 2018, EMS responded to 59,368 calls, of which 41,000 resulted in an Emergency Room transport. “I think that’s incredible for the amount of personnel we have in the city of Pittsburgh, and we’re currently at 201,” Hissrich said. “It’s amazing the amount of calls they are handling.” Chief Romano added: “This is the EMS leadership group now and for the future.

The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police believes strongly in being transparent. Transparency fosters trust.\" The policies are available on the city website (http://pittsburghpa.gov/police/manual-procedural-orders). Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said it is important to provide the public with the opportunity to review policies and how police officers may interact with the community. “Police are here to serve and protect the public, and they do so on a daily basis,” Director Hissrich said. “Transparency is a key component of building relationships with the community, and this is a positive and important step in that direction.” Mayor William Peduto applauded the move, which is the latest in the Bureau’s efforts to improve community relations. \"The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police has made great strides in community outreach and openness the last five years, from sharing crime data to joining the National Initiative and this latest move to share its internal policies with the public,” Mayor Peduto said. “I want to thank the leadership of the bureau and every last member of the force for their dedication to both protecting and opening dialogue with the greater Pittsburgh community.” Pittsburgh Police Cops and Kids Summer Camp 2019 (PITTSBURGH, PA) April 24, 2019 – This fall, go back to school with the best “What I did last summer” story of them all. For 12 years running, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police has been hosting children ages 8 to 12 at its annual Cops and Kids Summer Camp. Police are already gearing up for this year’s camp.

Campers will also have the opportunity to explore – up close – our SWAT vehicle, meet members of the police K-9 unit, and act as detectives in a mock crime scene. “Cops and Kids isn’t just a camp, but a life-changing experience,” Zone 4 Officer Tyler Pashel said. “I remember being 12 years old and in one of the very first Cops and Kids camps myself. The program gives young people the chance to not only interact with police, but interact with them in a positive, fun learning environment. Cops and Kids could be more than a fun summer camp. It could show kids that a career in public safety is their calling, like it did for me.” Each daily session runs from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Two meals, snacks, uniforms, and transportation to and from the campsite is provided. There is no fee to attend.

Six million Americans misuse controlled prescription drugs, according to the 2017 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. This Saturday, April 27, Pittsburghers have an opportunity to protect their communities and help diminish prescription drug abuse. From 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., all six Pittsburgh Police Zones, Phillips Rec Center in Carrick, and other locations around the city, will be accepting expired, unused, and unwanted prescription drugs for safe disposal as part of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s 17th National Take-Back Initiative. “We as a community need to do our part to help prevent drug addiction and overdoses. This day allows us to participate in the prevention,” said Pittsburgh Police Sergeant Rebecca Bassano. The federal Drug Enforcement Administration holds two Drug Take Back events each year. During the October event in Pittsburgh last year, police collected 318 pounds of drugs. Nationally, nearly 4,800 law enforcement partners participated in the event last fall, collecting a record 914, 236 pounds -- or 457 tons – of unused or unwanted prescription drugs. This initiative addresses a vital public safety and public health issue. Medicines that languish in home cabinets are highly susceptible to misuse, and abuse. Studies show that the majority of misused and abused prescription drugs are obtained from family and friends, including from the home medicine cabinet. In addition, Americans are advised that disposing of unused medicines by flushing them down the toilet or throwing them in the trash, poses potential safety and health hazards. For more information about the safe disposal of prescription drugs or about the April 27, Take Back Day event, visit www.DEATakeBack.com Drop off locations: Zone 1: 1501 Brighton Rd, 15212 Zone 2: 2000 Centre Ave, 15219 Zone 3: 830 E Warrington Ave, 15210 Zone 4: 5858 Northumberland St, 15217 Zone 5: 1401 Washington Blvd, 15206 Zone 6: 312 South Main St, 15220 Phillips Rec Center: 201 Parkfield St, 15210 Police Headquarters: 1203 Western Ave, 15233 For those who can’t participate this weekend, permanent drop-off boxes are located at Pittsburgh Police Headquarters and Zone 6. PITTSBURGH, PA (April 26, 2019) – Two sergeants were promoted to lieutenant and nine officers were promoted to sergeant Friday afternoon during a Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Promotion Ceremony in Council Chambers. William S. Hohos and Patrick L. Knepp were promoted to lieutenant. Sergeant promotions went to Christopher A. Braden, Brendan A. Flicker, Logan D. Hanley, Carla L. Kearns, Dawn M. Mercurio, Donald I. Mitchell, Jr., Mark J. Rush, Daniel R. Stoddard and William D. Watts. “We’re all leaders within the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, regardless of assignment,” Police Chief Scott Schubert said. “But you have the task of overseeing the shifts and ensuring that the philosophy, the mission, is being upheld and, most importantly, looking out for the welfare of our officers day in and day out to make sure they go home.” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said he was deeply impressed with the promoted officers' resumes. “I look at each personnel file and this is one of the most impressive selections I’ve seen,” Director Hissrich said. “The background of each of the sergeants and the officers being promoted today, the experience, the knowledge, the skills you present will certainly go a long way in providing security and expertise to the new officers coming on and the officers already on the street.” Mayor William Peduto swore in the newly-promoted lieutenants and sergeants. “Thank you for your dedication to the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, thank you for your dedication to the people of Pittsburgh,” Mayor Peduto said. “This promotion is based upon merit. You are being promoted because it is believed you have the ability to lead others, that you have through your career shown the ability to wear the uniform in a way that brings respect.” PITTSBURGH, PA (April 27, 2019) — The City of Pittsburgh’s Public Safety Department is aware of the synagogue shooting in Southern California and continues to monitor the situation. “We are in contact with our law enforcement partners in California, our local partners, and with federal law enforcement,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “We will enhance security precautions as necessary.” As always, Public Safety urges the public to remain vigilant and to call 911 if you see anything suspicious. “We understand this heartache all too well,” Hissrich said. “Our thoughts are with those in the San Diego area, and our actions locally are and will continue to be focused on keeping everyone safe.” PITTSBURGH, PA (May 2, 2019) -- A years-long investigation of gang activity in the city’s southern neighborhoods has resulted in multiple Grand Jury indictments and nine arrests — including the arrests of four people who are charged in the 2014 murder of Omar Hodges, a City of Pittsburgh refuse worker. The arrests clear multiple cases and dismantle the leadership of organized criminal groups that waged a violent war on the streets of Pittsburgh in October, 2014. -- On Oct. 11, 2014, three people were shot and wounded on the 3100 block of Cordell Place. -- On Oct. 12, 2014, one man was shot on the 3000 block of Arlington Avenue. -- On Oct. 13, 2014, Omar Hodges, 29, was fatally shot while sitting in his car on the 1300 block of Birmingham Avenue shortly before beginning his shift as a refuse collector. -- On Oct. 20, 2014, a male was kidnapped and tortured. The investigation connects additional crimes to the groups, including a Dec. 22, 2014 shooting of a man on Allen Street. Police investigated the violence from the start, at which time they determined that federal investigators were conducting a drug trafficking investigation of these groups. In 2016, Pittsburgh Violent Crimes Detectives (including Joseph Fabus, Garrett Spory and Edward Fallert) and Narcotics Detective Eric Harpster took over the investigation. Through their diligence and hard work, they connected the shootings and kidnapping to the federal drug investigation and obtained new evidence and witnesses. In 2018, a Grand Jury convened. The Grand Jury was necessary for several reasons, including to assure the protection of key witnesses from ongoing retaliatory violence. In January, 2019, the Grand Jury returned indictments on nine people in connection to the violence from October, 2014. Police have now arrested all nine suspects: Gemere Bey, 29, of Beltzhoover is charged with aggravated assault, kidnapping, burglary, terroristic threats and recklessly endangering another person. Christopher Bradley-Bey, 25, of Beltzhoover is charged with aggravated assault, kidnapping, burglary, terroristic threats and recklessly endangering another person. Holman Brown, 27, of Beltzhoover is charged with homicide, criminal conspiracy, aggravated assault, kidnapping, burglary, carrying a firearm without a license, terroristic threats and reckless endangerment of another person. Christopher Brown, 26, of Beltzhoover is charged with homicide, aggravated assault, and criminal conspiracy. Corey Cheatom, 27, of Beltzhoover is charged with homicide, attempted homicide, aggravated assault, criminal conspiracy, tampering with evidence, and other charges. Sheraun Davis, 35, of McKees Rocks is charged with attempted homicide, criminal conspiracy and aggravated assault. Shakeem Davis, 28, of McKees Rocks is charged with attempted homicide, criminal conspiracy and aggravated assault. Cody Duncan, 27, of Beltzhoover is charged with aggravated assault and criminal conspiracy. Lance Gardenhire, 43, of Beltzhoover is charged with homicide, aggravated assault and solicitation. Detectives relied on video evidence, ballistic evidence, cell phone analysis and social media analysis as part of the investigation. In addition, multiple witness statements were obtained by PBP detectives in locations across the country. The investigation revealed that the two violent groups -- “Zhoove” from Beltzhoover and “Darccide” from St. Clair Village -- engaged in an all-out turf war that included gang members placing bounties of up to $20,000 on the heads of rival gang leaders. Omar Hodges was a victim of this senseless battle. He had no gang affiliation. He was an innocent, hard-working man who was killed while sitting in his car and waiting to go to work simply because his car resembled the vehicle of a high-ranking gang leader. Four of the suspects arrested -- Lance Gardenhire, Chris Brown, Holman Brown and Corey Cheatom -- have been charged with homicide in Hodges’ death. These arrests illustrate that Pittsburgh Police do not rest on open investigations. Years may pass. But detectives continue to question and push for answers. The results of this investigation come from excellent collaboration between Homicide detectives, Narcotics detectives, the Intelligence Unit and Zone 3 detectives. This investigation also shows the importance of investigators receiving help from the public. When witnesses come forward, we solve crimes. Thanks to the cooperation of the public, nine dangerous people are in custody and facing significant prison sentences. Many agencies played a hand in this investigation, including: The Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, The US Attorneys Office, The Allegheny County Crime Lab. PITTSBURGH, PA (May 2, 2019) – This weekend is the 11th running of the Pittsburgh Marathon since its return in 2009. More than 35,000 people will participate in one or more of the weekend races, and tens of thousands of others will spectate from the sidelines. This is a major annual event, and as such residents and visitors to Pittsburgh should be aware of preparations, including road closures. Downtown road closures will begin Friday at noon on the Boulevard of the Allies between Wood Street and Stanwix Street. This closure will remain in effect through Sunday’s final races. Additional road closures will occur Saturday on the North Shore and Downtown for the 5K and Kids Marathon. Sunday will bring the largest number of road closures, affecting multiple neighborhoods, as the course wends 26.2 miles through the North Side, West End, South Side, East End and Downtown. Closures along the course route begin as early as 1:30 a.m. Sunday morning. Note: Cars that are not moved along the route will be towed. Marathon officials have spent months notifying residents who will be affected, and signs have been posted to signify the closures. For a full list of closures, go to https://www.thepittsburghmarathon.com/RoadClosures Public Safety and City officials will line the course with Marathon officials to make sure all goes smoothly. As always, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich reminds people that if you see anything suspicious, call 911. “We wish the best to all runners, and we hope those runners and spectators enjoy our city and the great tradition of the Pittsburgh Marathon,” Hissrich said. “Public Safety, including members of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, Pittsburgh Fire Bureau, Emergency Medical Services, Emergency Management as well as several partner agencies will be out in great numbers to assure that everyone stays safe.” PITTSBURGH, PA (May 2, 2019) The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is thrilled to introduce the newest, smallest, and definitely cutest member of the force, Zane. Zane is a 9-month-old purebred golden retriever who hails from a breeder in Latrobe, Pa. As the Bureau's first-ever comfort dog, his police duties will include providing aid during critical and traumatic incidents, peer support and community outreach. In Hebrew, Zane's name means \"gift and prayed for.\" Following the tragic mass shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Squirrel Hill last October, canine first responders from all over the country came to Pittsburgh to help comfort both first responders and the community. \"I watched people during the debriefings at that time who were anxious and didn't want to be there, but as soon as the dogs came in, you could just see their anxiety levels dropping,\" said Pittsburgh Police Sergeant Carla Kearns, who proposed the idea of finding a comfort dog for the Bureau. Zane will be in the care of Pittsburgh Police Officer Victoria Butch in Zone 4. As a Community Resource Officer who is specially trained in critical and traumatic incidents, crisis intervention, and community outreach, Officer Butch was the perfect fit as Zane's handler. Unlike the Bureau's other working dogs who can't be pet, Zane will be pivotal in helping calm victims of violent crime during interviews, as well during critical incidents and events. He will also be out in the community for meet and greets when he's ready to serve in about 6-8 weeks. Still in training for his new position, Zane still requires another round of shots, he will then attend obedience school before moving on to attain his comfort dog certification at Misty Pines in Sewickley. Once officially sworn, Zane will have a badge and all the rights of any other police canine. Welcome to the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Zane. PITTSBURGH, PA (May 4, 2019) – Crime rates dropped in Pittsburgh over the first quarter of the year, according to the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police’s Crime Analysis Unit. Overall, Pittsburgh saw a 7% decrease in all crimes compared to the same time frame last year and a 12% decrease compared to the five-year average. Violent crime was down 16% over the first quarter and down 29% over five years. “These first quarter numbers are encouraging and they are the result of the hard work our officers and detectives put in daily,” Police Chief Scott Schubert said. “But we recognize that work remains. We will continue in our commitment to community and relations-based police work with the ultimate goal of eliminating all crime.” The first quarter 2019 Uniform Crime Report (UCR) stat sheets for each individual zone have been posted to the zones’ Facebook pages. Below is the stat sheet for the entire city. \"A number of factors contribute to these positive trends, including the use of technology such as security cameras and the expansion of the ShotSpotter system,\" Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. \"But these improved numbers would not be possible without the work of Chief Schubert, his Command Staff and every officer who has embraced community police work. Pittsburgh is a great city. We are determined to make it great for everyone who lives, works and visits here.\" PITTSBURGH, PA (May 16, 2019) – Pittsburgh Public Safety and several partner law enforcement agencies are prepared to ensure a safe experience for all at the Garth Brooks concert Saturday at Heinz Field.

We are there to protect.” NOTE: Director Hissrich will hold a media availability to discuss the concert today at 1:30 p.m. in the Public Safety Conference Room on the 4th floor of the City-County Building. PITTSBURGH, Pa. (June 5, 2019) -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police has placed new Pride decals on patrol vehicles for the month of June to show support for Pride Month, which celebrates the LGBTQIA+ community. The decals are part of the Bureau’s ongoing work with the National Initiative and is in line with the task force Report on 21st Century Policing. \"The Pride decals as well as the other decals we proudly display on our vehicles throughout the year symbolize our focus on inclusiveness, community police work and building bridges with everyone in the City of Pittsburgh,\" Police Chief Scott Schubert said. \"We know that Pittsburgh is Stronger Together, and that means inclusion of every community and community member.\" Beyond the decals, the Bureau has a certified Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression trainer who developed a LGBTQIA+ curriculum as part of the Crisis Intervention Team training. The trainer has presented at state and national conferences on this topic. It is mandatory that all members of the Bureau go through LGBTQIA+ training. “Relationships can only be built at the speed of trust,” Commander Eric Holmes said. “Our decal program is yet another example of how we are working to build a bridge to the communities we serve.” The City of Pittsburgh and PBP believe the decals play an important role in celebrating diversity and inclusion. The Bureau scored 100% on the Equality Index from the Human Rights Campaign. https://bit.ly/2KqRQzx Pittsburgh Pride Celebrations will be held June 7-9 in areas throughout Downtown and the North Side.

(June 21, 2019) -- Pittsburgh is playing host this week to the 41st annual Mid-Atlantic Police Motorcycle Rodeo. In 1979, the first rodeo was held in the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area to build both skills and working relationships between motorcycle officers. This year, the main competition takes place tomorrow, Saturday, June 22, with 20 police departments and 78 riders taking part. With timed event courses such as the Mouse Trap and the Snowman and precision courses such as the Beehive, The Rattler and the Three Rivers, spectators will be treated to one of the finest displays of Police and EMS motorcycle skills in North America. For the 2019 event, the Mid-Atlantic Police Motorcycle Rodeo has chosen to support the Special Olympics of Pennsylvania to support year-round sports training and competition for children and adults with intellectual disabilities. See event details below. Location: Art Rooney Avenue outside Heinz Field Time: 8:30 – 9:00 a.m. Opening Ceremony with riders in full duty uniform. 9:00 – 11:00 a.m. Main Competition 11:00 – 12:00 LUNCH 12:00 – 2:00 p.m. Main Competition continues 2:00 – 4:00 p.m. Team Competition PITTSBURGH, PA (June 24, 2019) –Five officers were promoted to sergeant Monday afternoon during a Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Promotion Ceremony in Council Chambers. Anthony D. Agliori, Timothy H. Cole, Matthew P. Gardner, Maxfield P. Holz and Elizabeth Merkel were promoted to the rank of sergeant. “I think sergeant is one of the most critical positions within the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police,” Police Chief Scott Schubert said. “You’re going to have a lot of people coming up to you asking for advice that has nothing to do with work. Remember to treat them with respect, with compassion, because they might be dealing with something where they need advice, they need to talk. There’s nothing better than someone who stays there and listens to them.” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said he was consistently impressed with the officers’ level of devotion and dedication to the city, their integrity and their selfless desire to aid our communities. “They do this each and every day, often at the expense of time spent with their loved ones. I’d also like to thank the friends and families for their sacrifice, day in and day out, for understanding the role these officers play in protecting the city that we all love.” Mayor William Peduto swore in the newly-promoted sergeants. “A sergeant is somebody who is gone to in a crisis, in the moment when an incident is happening and the officers look to the sergeant to make that decisive call. But it’s not only in those crisis moments that your leadership will be needed. Your leadership will be needed every day...every day you wear that uniform. For you wear the uniform for all of those who have worn it before and everyone who will wear it after.” PITTSBURGH, PA (June 26, 2019) The Department of Public Safety and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police continually evaluate all of their duty locations in an effort to improve and enhance them where needed, and to provide the best police protection and service to city residents. To that end the Bureau of Police is today announcing important changes to its command staff, with four commanders moving to new positions within the Bureau. The changes are: Commander Jason Lando from Zone 5 to the Narcotics and Vice Division Commander Stephen Vinansky from Zone 6 to Zone 5 Commander Cristyn Zett from Zone 2 to Zone 6 Commander Reyne Kacsuta from Narcotics and Vice to Zone 2 Periodic personnel shifts are an effective way of providing professional development opportunities for command staff while providing a fresh perspective in their new posts. Additionally, new positions allow commanders to gain valuable experience in different communities, work with new officers and share original ideas and perspectives that will serve to enhance the effectiveness of the Police Bureau. With the level of professionalism and skill each of these commanders possess, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is assured this transition will be seamless and that our community will continue to be well-served. The transfers will be effective July 8, 2019. Maps of each of the six police zones are available here. Please join us in congratulating the commanders on their new posts. PITTSBURGH, PA (July 1, 2019) – Pittsburgh Public Safety and several partner law enforcement agencies will be out in force Thursday to ensure a safe experience for all during Fourth of July celebrations. As usual, Public Safety expects large numbers of people to congregate at various locations, including the North Shore, Downtown, Mt. Washington and Point State Park. Although certain consumer fireworks were legalized last year, fireworks are a fire hazard and pose significant dangers to humans. As a reminder, fireworks are not allowed in Point State Park. In addition, city law prohibits the use of any fireworks, even those that are legal, within 150 feet of any structure. Police will arrest and/or cite anyone caught illegally setting off fireworks. \"The Fourth of July is a great American tradition and a great Pittsburgh tradition, but we want and expect people to celebrate responsibly,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “As in past years, there will be zero-tolerance for any type of disorderly conduct, to include illegal use of fireworks, fighting, public intoxication, underage drinking, or any type of violence.” Other prohibited items in the park include, but are not limited to: Alcohol, drones, grills, laser pointers, weapons, explosives or ammunition. Open carry is not permitted. Law enforcement will establish security checks inside the park to screen bags for prohibited items. State, County and City Mounted Units will be present; River Rescue, Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire and the Coast Guard will be on the city’s three rivers to enforce laws. Pittsburgh EMS, State Park Rangers and multiple partner agencies, including Allegheny County Police, the County Sheriff’s Office, State Police, Port Authority Police and Juvenile Probation will team up to assure a safe experience for all. Temperatures are expected to be warm and humid. Please limit alcohol intake and drink plenty of water. Do not drink and drive. Patrols will be out searching for and arresting impaired drivers. Remember your pets: Many dogs are panicked by fireworks and will jump fences when they begin. In the days leading up to the Fourth of July, Animal Care & Control officers respond to an average of 10 loose dogs a day. Please keep them in a safe place. In addition, Public Safety reminds residents that celebratory gunfire remains a problem in many cities, particularly on the Fourth of July and New Year’s Eve. Any bullet discharged from a gun into the air must land somewhere, and when it does there is significant risk of injury or death. Pittsburgh Police in all six zones will respond to ShotSpotter activations and arrest anyone caught discharging a firearm in public. Lastly, regarding fireworks, Public Safety officials and UPMC gave a demonstration last year on the dangers of fireworks, even those that are now legal. A video of that event and more information can be found here: http://inside.upmc.com/fireworks_safety/ Public Safety wishes all a happy and safe Fourth of July. PITTSBURGH, PA (July 2, 2019) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police welcomed 24 new officers Tuesday evening during a Training Academy Graduation Ceremony for recruit class BR 18-03. The class of 24 graduates began their training on December 3, 2018. They will spend the next four months in field training, during which they will be partnered with experienced officers for further training before they can work on their own. Mayor William Peduto, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich and Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert were among those on hand to congratulate the officers during a ceremony at the Community College of Allegheny County’s Foerster Student Center. “This is not a job. This is a vocation,” Mayor Peduto said. “It is something that only a few get a calling to do in life. It is something where you will be with people in the worst moment of their life and they’ll be looking at you for comfort.” The class included one female, six veterans, and one recruit who holds a doctorate in music. “Take care of each other. You’re now part of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police family,” Director Hissrich said. “Rely on each other. Your training has really just begun. When you hit the streets take note of the good things that the officers do day to day and replicate it.” Chief Schubert told recruits they have the training, the newly-acquired skills, and the equipment to apply to real world situations. “It’s not an easy job and it comes with awesome power of discretion…power that you must not take lightly,” Chief Schubert said. “You’re in a rare position where you can change a life, save a life, or take a life, all in the same day. How you use that power will define who you are and what you stand for.” PITTSBURGH, PA (July 2, 2019) -- Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officers responded to a report of an altercation on a playground on the 300 block of Saline Street on Tuesday, June 25 at 4:45 p.m. Responding officers from Zone 4 found an adult male holding down a juvenile male on playground equipment. Officers immediately ordered the adult to release the juvenile. The adult accused the juvenile of vandalizing an abandoned construction truck near the playground. Both parties accused the other of throwing punches, and said they returned punches only in self-defense. Police did not witness the alleged assault(s), but video footage from the juvenile victim’s family also showed the adult pinning the boy down. Officers continued to investigate. On Saturday, June 29, Police applied for a warrant via summons for the adult actor, Thomas D’Andrea, 46. The District Attorney’s Office approved the charges. D’Andrea is charged with simple assault and criminal mischief. Police are continuing to investigate. D’Andrea is a City of Pittsburgh firefighter. He has been placed on administrative leave. The Office of Municipal Investigations is investigating. PITTSBURGH, PA (July 3, 2019) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police posted online the 2018 Annual Report. “As part of our commitment to transparency, we encourage members of the community to explore every aspect of the report to learn as much as possible about our agency and our efforts to keep our communities safe while serving the public with a high level of professionalism, courage, integrity, respect and compassion,” Police Chief Scott Schubert said. “Although 2018 was difficult on some levels, we are extremely proud of the many accomplishments our bureau achieved throughout the year.” The report details statistics including a 19 percent reduction in non-fatal shootings, 5 percent reduction in homicides, and 71 percent clearance rate in homicide cases. The report also provides information on the Bureau’s continuing body worn camera program, officer wellness, community outreach and neighborhood by neighborhood crime breakdowns. “What stood out most to me was how the community and Public Safety came together as one to overcome one of the darkest days in Pittsburgh history during the synagogue attack,” Chief Schubert said. “We will never forget the victims of the Tree of Life, New Light and Dor Hadash congregations or the selfless courage our officers and other members of Public Safety displayed during and after the senseless tragedy. Together, Pittsburgh showed the world that we are one and that we are truly stronger than hate.” To view the full report, go to: https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/6371_2018_Annual_Report_Draft_-_Final.pdf PITTSBURGH, PA (July 5, 2019) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police continues to investigate a double-shooting Downtown last night that occurred as crowds moved out of the Downtown area following Fourth of July celebrations. The latest on the investigation: Just after 11 p.m., several people became involved in a fight in Katz Plaza on the 600 block of Penn Avenue. Multiple gunshots were fired and two males were struck. Medics transported the victims to local hospitals in critical condition. At this time, both victims remain in critical condition. Detectives from the Violent Crimes Unit and Group Violence Intervention are actively investigating this shooting. That investigation includes looking for and speaking with witnesses, and checking for any video that captured the shooting. It is likely that numerous people witnessed the shooting as Downtown was extremely crowded at the time of the incident. We know from experience that when witnesses come forward, Police solve crimes. The Bureau encourages anyone with information on this shooting to call Police at (412) 323-7800. Moving forward, Public Safety will work with partner law enforcement agencies and the Mayor's Office to explore any and all options to avoid similar violence at future events in the city. This includes the possibility of additional buses to move people out of Downtown following the fireworks, additional lighting and additional patrols. As always, community outreach will play a key role in any decision-making process. Updates on the shooting investigation will be provided when available by the Public Safety PIO Office. NOTE: Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich, Major Crimes Commander Victor Joseph and additional members of Police Command Staff will be available today for a briefing at 11:30 a.m. at Police Headquarters.

The new paramedics are: Marvin Balk, Elliott Brown, Austin Hsin, Sean McGrath, Nicholas Okwiya and John Saliba. “They have been with us now for a period of six months and we are glad to swear them all in,” EMS Chief Ronald Romano said while addressing the families. “Thank you for being here for them and supporting them for the work they do for the citizens of Pittsburgh.” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich also addressed the families and friends of the new paramedics. \"There are challenges out there,” Hissrich said. “Every day will not be a save. Please provide them with the support that they need.” Mayor William Peduto swore the new medics into their new positions and called on them to show courage and compassion on the job. “To your family members, we thank you for sharing them with us,” Peduto said. “We will watch over them.” PITTSBURGH, PA (July 11, 2019) – Pittsburgh Bureau of Police obtained an arrest warrant Thursday afternoon in the double shooting on July 4, 2019 inside the Agnes R.

Attendees were both inside and outside homes on the street. At some point, there was an argument or disagreement in the street. Around 1:30 a.m., shots were fired and one person was struck multiple times. The victim was brought to a local hospital in critical condition. Detectives continue to follow leads and interview residents and potential witnesses. As we have stressed in the past: Investigations are greatly aided when people with information come forward and share it with police. If anyone has information on this shooting, please call Police at (412) 323-7800. Regarding the victim, Police can confirm that the shooting victim is Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Officer Calvin Hall. Officer Hall is a 2-year veteran of the Bureau, assigned to the Northview Heights Public Safety Center. He previously worked for Braddock Police. Officer Hall was hand-picked to work in the Northview Heights Public Safety Center because of his career-long dedication to community outreach. Sgt. Joseph Lewis, who heads the Northview Heights Public Safety Center, said he recruited Officer Hall because of his positive attitude and ability to relate to all people from all walks of life. “He was born and raised in the City of Pittsburgh and his ways of connecting to the community and to other officers was extremely beneficial for what we’re trying to do in Northview Heights,” Sgt. Lewis said. “He is always positive, always upbeat. I approached him and said, ‘I want you up here because of your personality and the way you interact with the community.’ He’s always smiling, always positive.” Officer Hall was in Homewood visiting friends when the shooting occurred. Officer Hall, 36, remains in critical condition. We ask that the media and public respect his family’s privacy while Officer Hall fights for his life. The family has asked that the media not contact them at this time. While the Bureau is deeply affected by Officer Hall’s shooting, it is important to note that the overnight hours of July 13-14 resulted in multiple other victims of senseless gun violence, none of whom should be overlooked or forgotten. In addition to the Monticello Street shooting, one person was shot and critically injured during a music concert at Nova Place, and two people were shot in Northview Heights, leaving one victim in critical condition. Police are actively investigating those shootings as well. Our primary directive as a Bureau is to eliminate violent crime. We will not waver in our pursuit of that goal. PITTSBURGH, PA (July 15, 2019) – Pittsburgh Bureau of Police have arrested Camerin Caldwell on an outstanding warrant in connection with the double shooting on July 4, 2019 inside the Agnes R. Katz Plaza in the Cultural District. Caldwell, 18, of the North Side turned himself into police at approximately 4:15 p.m. He is charged with criminal attempt homicide (two counts), aggravated assault (two counts), reckless endangerment (two counts), and firearms violations. Caldwell is currently being held in Allegheny County Jail. Original Press Release: https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=3110 Incident Background: https://pittsburghpa.gov/publicsafety/blotterview.html?id=143 PITTSBURGH, PA (July 17, 2019) — The following is a statement from Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Chief Scott Schubert: “It is with great sorrow and a heavy heart that I must inform the public that Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Officer Calvin Hall passed away earlier today at UPMC Presbyterian. “We as a Bureau are heartbroken. We are in mourning. We are supporting each other, and we are keeping Officer Hall’s family in our prayers and doing whatever we can to support and lift them in this dark, devastating time. “Officer Hall was on the force for two years after previously working for Braddock Police. In his time here he left an indelible mark on his brother and sister officers, as well as the community he served. He was known for his quick smile, ever-optimistic attitude and for his career-long focus on community policing. He was a model officer. He made it a priority to connect with residents, and succeeded in doing so. “Officer Hall was shot three times in the back July 14 on the 7300 block of Monticello Street. He fought valiantly for more than three days before succumbing to his injuries. “Regarding the investigation, we are investigating Officer Hall’s death as a homicide, and we are investigating the strong possibility, based on gathered evidence, that Officer Hall, who was off duty, was in fact acting under the color of the law when he was fatally shot. “That will be determined investigatively at a later date. Ceremonially, Officer Hall will receive the full burial honors that he deserves. “We all want answers. However, this is an ongoing investigation. As in all cases, we must maintain the integrity of the investigation and so we cannot comment further at this time. “We also ask again that media and the public respect the family's privacy while they mourn Officer Hall’s passing. Keep them in your prayers, but please give them the space they need and deserve at this dark time. “Additional information, including funeral arrangements, will be released by the PIO Office when available.” PITTSBURGH, PA (July 18, 2019) – The following is a statement from the family of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Officer Calvin Hall: “We would like to thank all of the doctors, nurses, and staff at UPMC Presbyterian who were involved in Officer Hall’s care. You worked incredibly hard to try to save his life, and for that we will be forever grateful. “We would like to thank all of officer Hall’s extended family -- the men and women in blue. Your support, love, and kind words will be imprinted on our hearts forever. “To Mayor William Peduto, thank you for all of your love and support. “To Police Chief Scott Schubert, the support you and your officers have shown to Officer Hall and our family was above and beyond the call of duty. Thank you. “We also want to thank Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich, Zone 1 Commander Christopher Ragland and Sgt. Joe Lewis, who was Officer Hall’s supervisor at Northview Heights, for your care and compassion. We will never forget all that you have done. “We want to thank everyone at the Northview Heights Public Safety Center. Officer Hall was so proud to be a part of a unit that was truly making a difference in the community. He spoke of his fellow officers and the substation often. We will not forget you. “To Officer Hall’s partner, Officer Reggie Eiland, there are no words that can adequately describe how grateful we are for the love, dedication and loyalty that you showed your fellow officer. You never left his side. You were there day and night, as were as so many other officers. We thank you, Officer Reggie, we thank you, Officer Joe Bucci, and we thank every other officer who showed their support, including the Chief of Police in Braddock, where Officer Hall worked before he came to Pittsburgh, who was there to support him and to offer his prayers. “There are so many others we want to thank, including those whose names we never learned. If we have forgotten anyone, please forgive us. But know that your kindness and devotion did not go unrecognized. We thank you all for working around the clock to support officer Hall and his family.” The family will make themselves available for media statements in the near future. However, they are not ready and continue to ask for privacy and space while they plan Officer Hall’s funeral. Those funeral arrangements will be announced once they are finalized. Regarding the investigation: It is active and ongoing. We have no updates at this time.

The National Weather Service is predicting high temperatures and humidity that could push the heat index to between 100 and 105 degrees. In anticipation of the extreme conditions, Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich, Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS Chief Ron Romano, Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Chief Darryl Jones, Parks and Recreation Director Ross Chapman, and the Chairman of UPMC’s Emergency Medicine Department Dr. Donald Yealy held a news conference to provide information on how residents can safely beat the heat while protecting children, the elderly, and pets. “We have not had a heat event like this in several years,” said Public Safety Director Hissrich. He added, “We will aggressively prosecute (for) animals that are left in vehicles, dogs, cats and certainly if we have a child left in a vehicle, that will be aggressively prosecuted as well.” Hissrich encouraged people to check on their elderly neighbors throughout the day, especially in the afternoon when temperatures peak. UPMC's Dr. Donald Yealy outlined some of the early warning signs of heat stress such as, “not feeling quite right,” upset stomach or feeling a little sweaty. “The later findings like difficulty breathing, passing out and maybe even suffering cardiac arrest, nobody has a problem identifying that, the goal is to never get to that point,” said Yealy. “Don’t ignore the early signals. The late ones are bad.” EMS Chief Romano urged city residents to drink plenty of fluids and stay in the house if they can, especially those with underlying medical conditions. He also reminded people that medics are always at the ready and to never hesitate to call 911 in the event of an emergency. “Certainly we’ll be available, we’ll probably be busier, but we’ll get there as soon as we can,” said Romano. Fire Chief Jones warned about a seemingly fun, but potentially dangerous way to cool down, by opening neighborhood fire hydrants. “We do not have a water shortage now, but if everyone decides to crack one open, then we can quickly have one,” said Jones. The City’s Parks and Recreation Director Ross Chapman suggested a better option would be checking out some of the city’s 18 public pools, eight spray parks and three cooling centers, the latter of which will have extended hours through the weekend. For more information on the locations and hours for the city’s cooling centers, pools, and spray parks: https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases.html?id=3133 PITTSBURGH, PA (July 19, 2019) – Funeral arrangements and other events have been finalized for Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officer Calvin Hall. On Saturday, July 20, Police will conduct an End of Watch Ceremony for Officer Hall at exactly 8 p.m., which is when his regular shift would normally end. The ceremony will take place in the 1500 block of Brighton Road, directly in front of Zone 1. To accommodate what is expected to be a large gathering, police will close Brighton Road from Pennsylvania Avenue to California Avenue from 7 p.m. until the ceremony ends. Additional closures include Jacksonia Street from Cameo Way to Brighton Road, Freedmore Street from Brighton Road to McCullough Street and Columbia Place and Wright Way off of Brighton Road. Port Authority buses will temporarily be re-routed during the ceremony. On Monday, July 22 the viewing for Officer Hall will be held at Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall, 4141 Fifth Avenue from 12 p.m. to 8 p.m. The family will not be present from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. On Tuesday, July 23 the funeral and memorial service for Officer Hall will be held at Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall at 11 a.m. Burial will follow at Homewood Cemetery. Officer Hall’s family has agreed that the funeral and burial will be open to the public. Media seating will be in a marked area in the balcony of Soldiers & Sailors. All media is asked to RSVP to PIO@pittsburghpa.gov. There will also be a designated media area at Homewood Cemetery. Media is again asked to RSVP. If and when the family makes itself available to media has not been determined. When they feel they are ready, media will receive an advisory announcing the location and time. PITTSBURGH, PA (July 22, 2019) In advance of the funeral service for Officer Calvin Hall on Tuesday, July 23 at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall, 4141 Fifth Avenue at 11 a.m., Pittsburgh Public Safety would like to outline some temporary road closures that will be in place. Fifth Avenue will be closed temporarily shortly before and shortly after the funeral service. Due to the large number of law enforcement expected to attend, at least one lane of Fifth Avenue will be closed and utilized for parking during the service. At least two lanes, plus the busway, will be reopened during the service, after vehicles are parked. Otherwise, there will be short, rolling closures to accommodate the funeral procession between Soldiers and Sailors and Homewood Cemetery, as well as on the North Shore and other areas while officers make their way in unison to the service. Public Safety Does not expect major traffic issues associated with the temporary road closures. However, traffic will likely be most affected in Oakland around Soldiers and Sailors. In addition, Pennsylvania State Police is informing commuters that road and bridge closures will be in place starting Tuesday, July 23 at 9:30 a.m. while law enforcement begins its procession to Soldiers and Sailors. Due to the road closures, the INBOUND HOV lanes will be open with no occupancy restrictions for commuting traffic throughout the morning. PSP and PennDOT ask commuters to avoid these areas for the morning hours if at all possible and use alternate routes. PITTSBURGH, PA (July 31, 2019) The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, in partnership with Vitalant, kicked off a month-long blood drive in honor of one of its own, Officer Calvin Hall. The Bureau was painfully reminded of the crucial importance of donating blood when Officer Hall, was shot and critically wounded while off-duty. While in the hospital, Officer Hall received several units of blood in an effort to save his life, but he later succumbed to his injuries on July 17, 2019. Officer Hall started each shift with what has become his signature motto, “Gotta go. Time for me to make a difference.” Today, fellow officers and command staff honored Officer Hall in kind, by making a difference through blood donation. Fifty registered donors, and some walk-ins, turned out to donate at the Vitalant mobile blood unit, making this the most successful blood drive ever held at Pittsburgh Police headquarters. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich got the ball rolling, showing up as the first donor of the day. “Calvin would have been the first in line if one of us required blood, so it is only appropriate that we are the first in line on the first day of the blood drive honoring him,” said Hissrich. Before donating, Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert said the idea to launch the special initiative came from witnessing first-hand the remarkable efforts that were taken to try to save Officer Hall’s life. “It meant a lot to us. That night we wanted to give blood, but obviously we couldn’t. But one of the things the hospital said was, ‘You can give blood, you can help make a difference with other people,’ That’s how Calvin lived and that’s how we want to live in his legacy and help save other lives,” said Schubert. Beginning August 1 through August 31, members of the public can also donate blood in Calvin Hall’s honor at any location simply by mentioning his name to Vitalant staff or by using a special group code: Z0021100. Schedule your blood donation at a Vitalant community blood drive or donation center during the month of August. To find a location near you, call (412) 209-7000 or visit vitalant.org/officerhall.

We are reminded yet again that the hatred that scarred Pittsburgh on Oct. 27, 2018 can strike anywhere and at any time. These events are, sadly, a part of modern American society and a part of modern police work. As always, Public Safety will rely on our Intelligence Units and on our close cooperation with local, state and national law enforcement agencies to detect and deter any similar type of terrorist activity being planned here. While we cannot discuss the specifics of our preparations, Public Safety is constantly planning and training for any and all types of incidents, including mass casualty shooting events. As part of those efforts, and as a result of the recent shootings, we have begun a reevaluation of precautions and planning for mass gatherings in the City of Pittsburgh. Of course, we cannot do it alone. As always: If you see something, say something. The most effective defense involves a partnership between law enforcement and the communities we serve. PITTSBURGH, PA (August 8, 2019) -- Pittsburgh Bureau of Police investigators made an arrest this evening following a double stabbing Downtown. James Wyatt, 23, of McKeesport was arrested on charges of criminal homicide and aggravated assault. He was booked into the Allegheny County Jail. A Zone 2 officer working out of the Downtown substation was on regular patrol around 11:40 a.m. when he stopped to conduct a welfare check on a woman who appeared to be sleeping or passed out at a bus stop on the 300 block of 6th Avenue. As the officer spoke to the woman, a man approached and assaulted her with a weapon, later determined to be a knife. The male then assaulted another woman who was walking past the bus stop. The officer confronted the male (James Wyatt), disarmed him and placed him in custody. The officer then rendered aid to the victims, who had been slashed with a knife. Medics arrived and transported the victims to local hospitals. The woman at the bus stop died as a result of her wounds. The second woman was listed in stable condition. Wyatt was taken to Police Headquarters for questioning before he was charged. At this time there is no evidence to suggest that this attack was racially or religiously motivated. The woman at the bus stop was not wearing religious garb. The second victim may have been wearing a hijab. “We will conduct a complete and thorough investigation of this tragic incident to include motive,” Major Crimes Commander Victor Joseph said. “At this time we do not have any evidence to suggest this was a hate crime.” Public Safety is deeply saddened to learn that six police officers with the Philadelphia Police Department were shot and injured today while responding to an active shooter situation in the Nicetown-Tioga section of the city. This senseless violence, on the heels of three recent horrific mass shootings in the United States, further highlights the dangers faced by modern law enforcement agencies in an effort to keep our communities safe. For the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, this hits especially hard. These are our brothers and sisters in blue who serve in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that we share. Many of us know or have worked with members of the Philadelphia Police Department and are well-aware of their professionalism and dedication to the profession. Our thoughts are with the officers and their families in the hope that they receive the care and support they need to recover fully and continue faithfully serving and protecting the City of Philadelphia. PITTSBURGH, PA (August 20, 2019) -- Pittsburgh Public Schools and other schools will welcome students back next week, meaning drivers need to exercise caution with the increase in kids traveling to and from school. To do our part in keeping our children safe, Pittsburgh Police will begin the new school year with a two week enforcement campaign during which every school zone will see strict enforcement periods in the morning and when school lets out. In addition, PBP officers will meet with Crossing Guards to prepare for the new year and to discuss any concerns that may have arisen last school year. Lastly, Police will also ensure that the flashing school zone signs, parking signs, and timing lines are all operational. Most students return to school on Monday, Aug. 26, with the exception of 10th and 11th grade students, who start on Aug. 27, and Kindergarten students, who start on Aug. 29. The enforcement period will begin next week as well. During the two-week morning and evening traffic enforcement, officers will actively look for and ticket motorists who pass a school bus with its red lights activated or who speed in school zones. The fine for passing a school bus with red lights activated is $250 plus $117.50 in court costs and state mandated fees; 5 points assessed to their license; and a 60-day driver’s license suspension. The fine for speeding in a marked school zone is $35 plus 117.50 in court costs and state mandated fees for up to 5 mph over the speed limit; $35 plus 117.50 in court costs and state mandated fees plus $2 per mile over the limit for six to 11 mph over the speed limit; and $500 plus $117.50 in court costs and state mandated fees for more than 11 mph over the speed limit. Additionally, police ask drivers dropping off and picking up students to know and comply with each schools’ policies for such activities. Drivers are also asked to follow parking restrictions on neighborhood streets while dropping off and picking up children. Slow down. Be attentive. Protect our students. PBP thanks everyone for doing their part. PITTSBURGH, PA (August 27, 2019) -- Beginning Thursday, August 29, 2019, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire will temporarily close Fire Station 8, located at 161 N. Euclid Avenue in East Liberty, for necessary repairs. Due to an ongoing structural issue in the station's hose tower, 8 Engine, Battalion 3, and 8 Truck, along with all Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire personnel housed in the station, will be moved to different stations while the rehabilitation takes place. The following shifts will occur: - Battalion 3 will move to Fire Station 7 in Stanton Heights, located at 4603 Stanton Avenue - 8 Truck will be housed at 18 Engine, located at 5858 Northumberland Street in Squirrel Hill - 8 Engine will shift to 15 Engine in Lincoln-Larimer at 7024 Lemington Avenue To ensure seamless service, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire will also be adding an additional truck to be housed at Station 7 in Stanton Heights. By diffusing personnel and vehicles between three temporary locations, residents who are currently served by Fire Station 8 will have uninterrupted service and those neighborhoods helping to house them will not be overburdened during this transitory period. Fire Station 8 will not function as a working fire house during repairs. There is no immediate timeline for completion of the work. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire would like to thank residents in all of these areas for their patience and understanding while these necessary repairs are performed for their safety and the safety of our firefighters. PITTSBURGH, PA (September 12, 2019) – One lieutenant was promoted to the rank of captain and six firefighters were promoted to the rank of lieutenant during a Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire promotion ceremony in Council Chambers. Before the promotions were awarded, Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Chief Darryl Jones asked everyone to observe a moment of silence to remember the events of September 11, 2001, as well as the other first responders and military personnel who have made the ultimate sacrifice. “Today’s a special day,” said Jones. \"There’s two really good days in the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire. The first one is when we graduate a recruit class and the second is when we promote firefighters. I’m so glad to have a group of guys here who have worked so hard and have earned the titles they’re getting ready to receive.” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich administered the oath of office during the promotion ceremony, acknowledging the depth and breadth of experience the group brings to the crews they guide. “You’re the ones who make the difference out there. You’re the ones who are going to arrive first on the scene. What you do in the first five to ten minutes of an incident could very well dictate the outcome. Some incidents may be over in 20 minutes, some incidents might go on for hours. But it’s your leadership that leads the way,\" said Hissrich. Michael Schanck was promoted to the rank of captain. Rard Perkins, Christopher Thomas, Ryan King, Wayne Smith, Matthew Smith, and Robert Peifer were promoted to the rank of lieutenant. Note: Wayne Smith was not in attendance. PITTSBURGH, PA (Sept. 12, 2019) -- The Department of Defense, in conjunction with local and federal law enforcement, will conduct training in and around the greater Pittsburgh area Sept. 16 through Sept. 22. This is a planned exercise in cooperation with local authorities and is not in response to any current events. The exercise is expected to have minimal impact on the public. To maintain the highest level of safety, there are no public viewing or media opportunities planned during this event. The City of Pittsburgh and Public Safety welcome the D.O.D., which provides Pittsburgh Police with the unique opportunity to receive the best training in the world while they are here. PITTSBURGH, PA (Sept. 12, 2019) -- In response to multiple media inquiries regarding crime statistics in the Central Business District, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police’s Crime Analysis Unit has compiled a comprehensive look at calls for service and crime in the area over the last five years. The City of Pittsburgh, Public Safety and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police take any and all crime in any part of the city seriously. However, we understand the recent scrutiny on Downtown and the Cultural District following four stabbings, including one fatal, in August. Police have increased patrols Downtown, an effort that resulted in an immediate arrest following every August stabbing. Some analysis highlights: -- Total Part 1 crimes for the first 8 months of the year 2019 are essentially unchanged from the 5 year average for the same time period 2014-2018 -- Part 1 Property crimes show a 4% decrease compared to the 5 year average -- August 2019 Part 1 Crimes shows a 10% decrease from the average August over the last 5 years -- Four (4) aggravated assaults in August are slightly higher than the 5 year average of 3.75 -- Robberies were down 67% at 3, compared to the average of 9 robberies at this point in the year over the last 5 years. -- Over the last 5 years, violent crimes have been more likely to occur between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. View the full report here Regarding the Downtown substation, it is open daily from 11 a.m. until 11 p.m. and often stays open until midnight or later during large events Downtown. A desk officer is on shift every day during those hours. In addition to the desk officer, there are a number of officers on patrol from the substation. Their exact numbers vary depending on need. For officers assigned to the substation, their primary responsibility is to perform foot patrols in the Downtown core. The most common calls to police covering the Downtown area over the past year (July to July) were: 1) disorderly person (824) 2) burglary alarm (761) 3) parking complaint (526) 4) welfare check (469) 5) trespass (362) In the name of transparency, Public Safety will continue to provide regular crime analyses to the public. PITTSBURGH, PA (Sept. 13, 2019) – Pittsburgh Public Safety will conduct a safety drill Monday, Sept. 16 at and in conjunction with the Convention Center. The public safety drill will involve an active threat scenario. It will occur out of public view inside the Convention Center, but people in the area may see emergency vehicles. Officials will close 10th Street between Fort Duquesne Boulevard and French Street from 6 p.m. until midnight. The drill will begin at 8 p.m. and end at midnight. Multiple bureaus and agencies from Pittsburgh Public Safety and Allegheny County will participate in the drill. The public safety drill is not open to the public or media. PITTSBURGH, PA (September 19, 2019) — A joint task force that included members of Pittsburgh Police, Allegheny County Police and FBI Pittsburgh attempted to serve an arrest warrant for a bank robbery suspect Wednesday night (Sept. 18) on the 900 block of Center Street in Wilkinsburg. Law enforcement encountered the suspect in an apartment building around 9:15 p.m. In an apparent attempt to avoid being taken into custody, the suspect held a female at knife point and threatened to harm her. Fearing for the woman’s life, two law enforcement officials opened fire and shot the suspect. He was pronounced deceased at the scene. Allegheny County Police, in conjunction with the FBI, will handle the shooting investigation. The woman held at knifepoint was not injured. A Pittsburgh Police detective sustained a minor leg injury and was transported to a local hospital in stable condition. No other law enforcement officials were injured. A thorough investigation will be conducted. A shooting incident review team, including the FBI's Inspection Division and Allegheny County Police investigators, will interview witnesses and gather information for a presentation to a Shooting Incident Review Group. (SIRG) More information will be released when available. PITTSBURGH, PA (September 21, 2019) – Multiple people are facing criminal charges following a violent assault at a North Side gas station that was caught on video and went viral on social media due to its disturbing nature. Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officers responded to a report of a fight on the 2500 block of Brighton Road on Friday around 6:45 p.m. between the male gas station owners and two female customers. Per the initial investigation: A verbal confrontation began over spilled gas. The customers said a pump malfunctioned and demanded a refund. The store owners denied the refund. A verbal confrontation quickly became violent. As part of the investigation, officers reviewed multiple videos of the incident. One video taken by a bystander showed a lengthy physical confrontation in which the male store owners struck one of the females in the back of the head multiple times, and an employee grabbed one of the females by her hair and dragged her across pavement. Police also reviewed the gas station’s security camera which showed the female customer initiating the confrontation inside the store before it moved outside. As a result of the investigation, Police determined that assault charges should be filed against the gas station owners and employee. Police submitted the paperwork to the Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office Friday night. If the District Attorney determines that charges should rise above simple assault to the level of aggravated assault, the paperwork will be amended. Police investigate all violence seriously. The video showing the assault on these women is particularly disturbing as multiple men held down the women while punching them repeatedly. Police are continuing to investigate, which will include a review of any dash cam video and body cam video. Additional charges could follow. Anyone who may have witnessed the incident is asked to call Zone 1 detectives at (412) 323-7201. PITTSBURGH, PA (September 23, 2019) – A taskforce of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police detectives and federal law enforcement officials arrested a man early Monday morning in connection with drug overdoses that left three people dead in the South Side. The investigative team identified Peter Rene Sanchez Montalvo, aka Carlos, as the individual who provided the drugs to the overdose victims. Police responded to multiple overdoses early Sunday, Sept. 22, at an apartment complex in the South Side. Detectives from the Pittsburgh Police’s Narcotics and Vice Unit, Drug Enforcement Agency agents, and the FBI's Opioid Task Force immediately began a joint investigation. Sanchez Montalvo was taken into custody without incident at a house in McKees Rocks 3 a.m. this morning. Criminal charges are being handled by the US Attorney's Office. Investigators confirmed that Sanchez-Montalvo was at the Insomnia Discotec in Brookline on Saturday night, where orange wristbands were distributed to patrons. All of the overdose victims wore orange wristbands. At some point in the evening, Sanchez-Montalvo left Insomnia and went to the South Side apartment, where he had been staying. Several other individuals who were at Insomnia, including members of the band that played at the bar on Saturday night, joined him for what was described as an \"after-party.\" Sanchez-Montalvo distributed a white powdered substance, believed to be cocaine, to those in attendance. Shortly after, multiple people became seriously ill. Three of them died at the scene. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich, who was on scene Sunday morning when the overdoses were first reported, thanked Pittsburgh EMS, Fire and Police for their swift responses Sunday morning and for working tirelessly to save lives. In addition, he thanked the public and media for providing important information during this incident. Hissrich also thanked law enforcement agencies, including the FBI’s Western Pennsylvania Opioid Task Force, which is comprised of law enforcement officers from the FBI, Port Authority Police of Allegheny County, the Allegheny County Police Department, Allegheny County Sheriff’s Office, the North Versailles Police Department and the Stowe Twp. Police Department, along with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Any questions concerning charges/prosecution in this case should be referred to the US Attorney's Office. PITTSBURGH, PA (September 27, 2019) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire is pleased to announce it has been awarded more than $1 million in federal and civic funding to help equip the deaf and hard of hearing with life-saving smoke and fire detection devices for their homes. FEMA will provide more than $950,000 through its Fire Prevention Safety Grants, while the City of Pittsburgh will contribute close to $50,000 for the two-year program. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire will work closely with the Center for Hearing and Deaf Services in Pittsburgh to identify local recipients who will receive the devices and learn how to use them. The specialized smoke and fire detectors will vary depending on individual needs. Some of the devices work in conjunction with audible smoke detectors to activate visual cues such as strobe lights. Others can be worn on the body as pager-type monitors that vibrate and alert people wherever they may be in the home. Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Chief Darryl Jones says the funding will go a long way toward protecting a population that is underserved when it comes to fire safety. “The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) states people who are deaf or are hard of hearing face unique challenges in an emergency. Their ability to detect a fire or escape its effects can be hindered. As a result, they are at a greater risk of death or injury due to fire. The most pressing fire safety issue for people who are deaf or hard of hearing is whether they will be alerted to danger in time to escape. These specially-designed devices are expensive to buy and install in a home - much more so than the standard smoke detectors you'd find at a hardware store. Those who are deaf or hard of hearing should not be prevented from protecting themselves and their families in the event of a fire simply because it is cost-prohibitive,” said Jones. Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Inspector / Fire Prevention Officer Lisa Epps will lead the training programs to teach recipients how to operate the safety equipment and install it in their homes. An announcement on the start date and eligibility for the program will be made at a later time. PITTSBURGH, PA (Sept. 27, 2019) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, in conjunction with Allegheny General Hospital and FBI Pittsburgh, today announced the launch of the Scentsational Tracking Program featuring the Police Bloodhound. The goal of the program is to create a safety net for those who might get lost and have trouble finding their way home. PBP and Allegheny General Hospital will assist residents in collecting and packaging the scent of a loved one in a sterile container. The family maintains the scent container, which is usable for seven years. Should a loved one go missing, the family gives the sealed scent container to Police for the Bloodhound to track. “The Bloodhound’s skills are honed to a point where it can differentiate between identical twins,” said Police Lt. Charles Henderson, who oversees the tracking program. “Where this is going to be most beneficial is with our most vulnerable communities, people who have cognitive disabilities and are prone to being lost. But we’ll do this for anyone who wants it.” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich noted that the Bloodhound will be available to other communities in western Pennsylvania. “Whether it’s a senior citizen or a child, we’ll be able to work with our partners in the FBI and find the missing child or adult,” Hissrich said. “And we will share that asset with everyone who wants to use it. All of our assets -- whether it be the explosives dogs, drugs dogs, the fireboat -- whatever we have will respond outside the city, which we do almost every day.” The Scentsational Tracking Program officially launched today at Point State Park where the Bureau’s current Bloodhound, Cappy, and his handler, Officer Kevin Merkel, gave a demonstration by tracking a Public Safety employee. “You just saw firsthand how important these dogs will be to investigations across our area,” said FBI Pittsburgh Supervisory Special Agent Scott Argiro. “We have a long-standing partnership with the Pittsburgh Police special ops team and have worked many of these cases side by side. These dogs are one more incredible tool we add to our tool box. Their specialized training allows them to help all of us find a scent and a lead to follow very early on. When every minute counts, those leads are crucial.” Allegheny General Hospital donated the containers and equipment, meaning the program is free to all who wish to participate. How to get involved: Police will host community outreach events at which the containers will be provided. In addition, Allegheny General Hospital will collect scents at regular appointments. Lastly, residents can call their local Police Zone and ask for a Community Resource Officer or Neighborhood Resource Officer for more information. Additional Background: Bloodhounds are one of the top canine breeds for scent discrimination. They search for skin cells that have fallen from their target. The bloodhound can differentiate the odor of the target from other people. Storing the scent correctly is an important part of the program. The scent is collected and packaged according to the best practices outlined by the FBI. It is best stored in a refrigerator. If that is not feasible, then storing the sample at a temperate less than 76 degrees Fahrenheit and at a humidity level less than 60 percent will be the next best option. Not breaking the seal of the container until needed will ensure that the scent is not contaminated. PITTSBURGH, PA, (September 30, 2019) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS was honored today with the American Heart Association’s 2019 Mission: Lifeline EMS Gold Plus Performance Achievement Award. The honor recognizes the critical life-saving role of EMS in providing care to patients suffering from an acute myocardial infarction, or a heart attack. “The City of Pittsburgh EMS is driving improvements in the care and outcomes of the residents of the City of Pittsburgh.” said the American Heart Association’s Gina Hrach, Director of Quality Systems Improvement. Hrach presented the award to Pittsburgh EMS Chief Ron Romano, who received it on behalf of the Bureau. Romano thanked all EMS personnel for all of their hard work and dedication that made the award possible. Assistant Chief Mark Pinchalk thanked all EMS partners for helping them meet a difficult metric. “We see approximately 60 patients per year having a STEMI - or ST Elevation MI – where the goal is from the time we get a paramedic on scene, until they are in the cardiac catheterization lab, and their vessels open and their heartbeat’s reprofused is less than 90 minutes. We were able to achieve that metric in about 80 per cent of our cases for 2018 and our average time is around 80 minutes. So, that’s a pretty good metric we’re able to pull off with the resources we have available to us,” said Pinchalk. City of Pittsburgh Medical Director Dr. Ron Roth provided a different measure to highlight EMS skills in Pittsburgh. He recounted the story of a participant in last year’s Great Race where a runner went into cardiac arrest near the finish line, but was revived by paramedics and doctors. This year he ran the 10 K race with his family and thanked Pittsburgh EMS for the ability to do so. “We saw him not as a percentage or a number. We saw him as a father, a husband, and he introduced his little grand baby. And I think we saw what we get from being very vigilant and all the hard work our city medics do. ” said Roth. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich echoed those sentiments. “You have the statistics, but to each statistic there’s a human life involved, whether it’s a father, mother, son, daughter, it’s important to the individual, whether or not they’re a resident, whether they’re a visitor to the city of Pittsburgh,” said Hissrich, congratulating paramedics and EMT’s on the award. Mayor William Peduto commended Pittsburgh EMS and hospitals for working hand-in-hand to provide critical care in the City of Pittsburgh. “While you’re here, whether you’re a resident or a visitor, you will be given the best care possible,” said Peduto. This is the second year in a row the Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS has received this elite status award from the American Heart Association. PITTSBURGH, PA (Oct. 18, 2019) – The City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Public Safety continues to prepare for President Donald Trump’s planned visit Downtown on Wednesday, Oct. 23. Several streets around the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, where the President will speak at the Shale Insight conference, will be closed that day after the morning rush hour. The closures will likely impact the evening commute. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich cautions that traffic will be a major concern. “As with any high profile event, Pittsburgh Public Safety and our partner law enforcement agencies are taking every step to address all safety concerns,” Hissrich said. “However, we can certainly use the public’s help. Traffic Downtown and around the Convention Center will be bad. I urge anyone who can avoid the area to do so.” Hissrich recommends that people who work Downtown consider working from home Wednesday or leaving early. He suggests Downtown schools allow early dismissal for students. Traffic will also be affected by rolling road closures to accommodate the President’s motorcade as he travels to and from the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. Public Safety will continue to prepare through the weekend and into next week. More specifics details will be provided Monday afternoon during a media availability with Director Hissrich and Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officials. Officials will also address safety preparations for events marking one year since the Tree of Life tragedy. Time and location for media availability will be announced Monday morning. PITTSBURGH, PA, (October 22, 2019) – Communities around the country and across the Commonwealth continue to struggle with escalating drug addiction, some of which begins with easily-accessible prescription drugs. In fact, nearly 10 million Americans have misused controlled prescription drugs, according to the 2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. That’s an increase of nearly 4 million from the previous year’s survey. From 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. on Saturday, October 26, Pittsburgh will have the opportunity, for the second time this year, to participate in the Drug Enforcement Administration’s 18th National Prescription Drug Take Back Day in an effort to diminish devastating drug abuse in our communities. In April, nearly 420 pounds of expired, unused, and unwanted prescription drugs were collected for safe disposal at all six Pittsburgh Police zone stations, Police Headquarters, and the Phillips Rec Center in Carrick. Nationally, nearly 5,000 law enforcement partners participated in the April initiative, collecting close to 470 tons of unused or unwanted prescription drugs. \"By dropping off unneeded pill bottles and prescription drugs for safe disposal you're ensuring that those drugs, which may seem harmless when used for their intended purpose, don't fall into the wrong hands,\" said Sergeant Rebecca Bassano, Pittsburgh Police Narcotics and Vice . This initiative addresses a vital public safety and public health issue. Medicines forgotten or left behind in the home are highly susceptible to misuse and abuse. Studies show that the majority of misused and abused prescription drugs are obtained from family and friends, including from the home medicine cabinet. In addition, Americans are advised that disposing of unused medicines by flushing them down the toilet or throwing them in the trash, poses potential safety and health hazards. All expired, unused, and unwanted prescription drugs can be dropped off at the following locations this Saturday: Zone 1: 1501 Brighton Rd, 15212 Zone 2: 2000 Centre Ave, 15219 Zone 3: 830 E Warrington Ave, 15210 Zone 4: 5858 Northumberland St, 15217 Zone 5: 1401 Washington Blvd, 15206 Zone 6: 312 South Main St, 15220 Phillips Rec Center: 201 Parkfield St, 15210 Police Headquarters: 1203 Western Ave, 15233 For those who can’t participate this weekend, permanent drop-off boxes are located at Pittsburgh Police Headquarters and Zone 6.

PITTSBURGH, PA (October 30, 2019) – On Tuesday, October 29, the Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS held a swearing-in and awards ceremony in Council Chambers. Three new paramedics were sworn in, while one EMT was promoted to paramedic. Quinton Gravagna, Michael Janczewski, and Michael Limbacher were sworn in as paramedics. EMT Lawrence Turner was promoted to paramedic. Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS Chief Ronald Romano recognized Turner’s sacrifice of studying to reach his goal, while working full-time. He also congratulated the new paramedics and thanked their families for supporting them in the work they do for the citizens of Pittsburgh. Medical Director Dr. Ronald Roth thanked them for choosing a career to help others. “You will always be the most important part of EMS because of your compassion and your goal to always do the right thing,” said Dr. Roth. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich recognized the rich history of EMS in Pittsburgh and the bright future of the Bureau. “We have one of the best emergency medical services in the country, supported by the first responder community. “The new faces are the future of EMS within the City of Pittsburgh,” said Hissrich. Mayor William Peduto acknowledged the pivotal role of EMS during the tragic shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue on October 27, 2018, with EMS working side by side with SWAT to help save lives. “May they be an example to you of what you can do in this career. And it’s not really a career, it’s a vocation because many people wouldn’t choose to be with people at their scariest moment,” said Peduto. EMS District Chief Mike Rogers presented special awards to one civilian and six EMS workers who went above and beyond the call of duty to help the public. Dennis Robinson - Civlilan Service Award District Chief Jeffrey Meyer - EMS Cross Award Paramedic Patrick Gilchrist - Meritorious Service Award Crew Chief Justin Sypolt - Medical Director's Award District Chief Antwain Carter - Meritorious Service Award Paramedic Michael Bess - Meritorious Service Award Paramedic Dawnshalay Williams - Meritorious Service Award PITTSBURGH, PA (October 30, 2019) – Public Safety is urging trick-or-treaters to stay safe in the city this Halloween. The weather forecast is less-than-ideal during the City of Pittsburgh’s established trick-or-treating hours of 5:30 until 7:30 p.m. Temperatures are expected to drop from a high of 68 degrees during the day, down to the low 50’s during trick-or treat hours, with a wind chill that will make it feel much colder. There is also significant rainfall in the forecast during that time. Public Safety suggests that parents ensure their children’s costumes are reflective, light in color, and that any masks or makeup provide full visibility for crossing streets. Adding small clip-on lights to the front and back of a costume can also provide another measure of visibility. Although some children may not want toadd gloves, hats, or water-resistant jackets and footwear to their super hero or princess costumes, this may be essential to enjoying the night comfortably. According to statistics from the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Collision Investigation Unit, there has not been a fatal collision and there have not been any documented police reports of children struck by vehicles on Halloween night over the past five years in Pittsburgh. That’s good news. However, in that same five-year time period, there have been 33 pedestrian/vehicle collisions in the month of October when it gets darker earlier in the evening. Public Safety would like to remind drivers to slow down during trick-or-treat hours, even more so during inclement weather, and for parents to assist children crossing the street during that time to ensure a safe and enjoyable Halloween. PITTSBURGH, PA (Oct. 30, 2019) -- The Northview Heights Public Safety Center has been renamed after late Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Officer Calvin Hall. Officer Hall strove always to connect with the communities he served, and he started each shift with the words: “Time for me to make a difference.” Those words now grace the building where Officer Hall worked until his final roll call in July. Two plaques were unveiled during a ceremony on Sunday, which would have been Officer Hall’s 37th birthday. “We are here today to celebrate the life of Calvin Hall, and also to dedicate a building where he worked,” said Pittsburgh Police Sgt. Joe Lewis, who leads the Officer Calvin M. Hall Public Safety Center. “He made a difference in multiple people’s lives, including mine and including every person who’s standing here now.” About 100 people attended the ceremony, including city leaders, Police Command Staff, Northview Heights residents, Zone 1 Commander Christopher Ragland and Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich. “Working this substation requires a hands-on, community-focused approach as this a neighborhood that has been underserved for years,” Hissrich said. “But it’s exactly where Officer Hall wanted to be. He dedicated himself to building bridges. He truly did make a difference.” Mayor William Peduto noted that the community lost an exemplary officer far too early. “Calvin Hall dedicated his life to public safety, and I hope a lot of the young ones here today will consider doing the same,” Mayor Peduto said. The safety center officially opened on Dec. 4, 2018. Created in collaboration with the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh and the Buhl Foundation’s One Northside Initiative, the safety center serves residents of Northview Heights and Allegheny Dwellings. It is designed to improve quality of life for residents and to strengthen relationships between the community and the officers who serve them. It is fitting that the building is now named after Officer Hall, who specifically requested an assignment at the substation because of his passion for community police work. “He left an indelible mark on his brother and sister officers, as well as the community he served,” Police Chief Scott Schubert said. “He was known for his quick smile, ever-optimistic attitude and for his career-long focus on community policing. He was a model officer. He made it a priority to connect with residents, and succeeded in doing so.\" PITTSBURGH, PA (Nov. 14, 2019) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police welcomed 34 new officers during a Graduation Ceremony for its most recent recruit class. The class began their training on April 4, 2019. They will spend the next four months working in the field, during which time they will be partnered with experienced officers for further instruction before they can work on their own. Mayor William Peduto, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich and Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert were among those on hand to congratulate the officers during a ceremony at the University of Pittsburgh’s Alumni Hall. Chief Schubert reminded the new officers of the immense responsibility their position holds. \"It's not an easy job and it comes with awesome power and discretion, power that you must not take lightly. You are in a rare position where you can change a life, save a life, or take a life...all in the same day.\" The class includes seven officers who previously worked for other agencies but chose to join the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. \"You will become representatives of this city and your mission. You will become role models for young children and the foundation of our communities,\" said Director Hissrich. Before delivering the oath of office, Mayor Peduto told the graduating class what it truly means to be a Pittsburgh Police officer. \"It requires honor and integrity because you don't wear the uniform for you. You wear that uniform and that badge for everybody who wore it before you and everybody who will wear it after. There's a long, proud tradition within the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.\" PITTSBURGH, PA (Nov. 18, 2019) – With Light Up Night festivities planned for Friday, Nov. 22, Public Safety is preparing for large crowds at venues throughout the Downtown area. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich welcomes residents and visitors to the events that mark the start of the holiday season in Pittsburgh. “As a native of this region, I am very much aware that Light Up Night is a wonderful Pittsburgh tradition that is especially popular with families,” Director Hissrich said. “As Public Safety Director, I can assure everyone planning on attending that we have taken steps to make this a safe experience for all.” As with other large events Downtown and elsewhere in the city, a significant police presence will help maintain safety, Hissrich said. Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will work with partnering law enforcement agencies -- including the Allegheny County Sheriff’s Office, Allegheny County Police, Pennsylvania State Police, Port Authority Police and State Park Rangers -- to provide uniformed and plainclothes officers throughout the venues. Mounted Units from the city, county and state will be present, as will River Rescue and the Fire Boat, Pittsburgh EMS, Pittsburgh Fire and Emergency Management. Public Safety will also utilize SkyWatch, which provides officers with a bird’s-eye view of crowds. “We will have a zero-tolerance policy for anyone who chooses not to be law-abiding,” Hissrich said. “That means no disorderly conduct, no fighting, no public intoxication or underage drinking, and no type of violence will be tolerated.” The weather will be seasonable with forecasted temperatures in the 40s and a possible shower. Traffic, as always, will be a concern. Attendees are urged to be patient and to use public transportation. Police remind the public that drones are not allowed, nor are illegal weapons. In addition, city law prohibits the use of any fireworks, even those that are legal, within 150 feet of a structure. Public Safety wishes all a happy and safe holiday season. PITTSBURGH, PA (December 3, 2019) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police held a promotions ceremony Tuesday afternoon in the Mayor’s Conference Room where Officer Phil Lerza was promoted to the rank of sergeant. Having spent the last decade working with the K-9 Unit, Sergeant Lerza will celebrate his 19th year with the Bureau this month. Police Chief Scott Schubert thanked him for taking on a leadership role. “We’re a big family, not just with police, but within the City of Pittsburgh. I have no doubt that you’ll lead as a guardian and you’ll use your professional judgement, your experience, and your compassion to help make Pittsburgh an even safer and better place to live.” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich congratulated Sergeant Lerza on his promotion and thanked him for his work with the K-9 Unit. “It might be a little bit different not having your K-9 partner out there, but you’ll be dealing with the officers out on the street and I’ve always said that the sergeants and lieutenants, they make the difference day to day throughout the city. Their split-second decisions and their supervision of the officers most definitely make a difference between life and death.” Mayor William Peduto recalled the tragic night in January of 2014 that then-Officer Lerza’s K-9 partner, Rocco, was stabbed in the line of duty, later succumbing to his injuries. Peduto remarked on Lerza’s compassion during that moment. “There wasn’t an ounce of anger within you, just the loss and sorrow of losing a friend. That’s the type of person I am really honored to promote because that’s the same sense that will be needed as you go through the next several years training the young officers we continue to recruit and to graduate.” Sergeant Lerza will be assigned to Zone 5 under the leadership of Commander Stephen Vinansky. PITTSBURGH, PA (December 3, 2019) -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Emergency Medical Services held a Swearing In Ceremony for four new EMTs and three new Paramedics Tuesday afternoon in the Mayor’s Conference Room. EMS Chief Ronald Romano thanked the families of the new EMTs and Paramedics for sacrificing their family lives for the betterment of the city. “I thank you for being here for them and supporting them in the work they do for the citizens of Pittsburgh,” Chief Romano said. “I thank you for sharing them with us and understanding when they miss a family event because they were helping someone else.” The new EMTs are: Sarah Geyer, John O’Rourke, Nathan Orr and Arley Stoker. The new Paramedics are: Matthew Fisher, Richard Fredell and Nathanial Roper. “Time passes very quickly and before you know it, you may be back in here for another promotion as a District Chief, Division Chief or maybe even Chief of this department,” said Medical Director Dr. Ronald Roth. “Please cherish every day.” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich thanked the city and Mayor William Peduto for supporting EMS with increased staffing levels. “I’d also like to thank everyone that day in and day out saves lives and sometimes puts their own lives on the line,” Hissrich said. “Welcome, congratulations and best of luck.” Added Mayor Peduto: “On behalf of the people of the City of Pittsbrgh, thank you for this vocation and for starting this journey today. … This is a unit that is recognized internationally. People come to train with Pittsburgh EMS from around the world to learn the practices that are happening right here.” PITTSBURGH, PA (Dec. 4, 2019) -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police honored 93 officers and traffic guards during the second annual Years of Service Recognition Ceremony Dec. 3 at the Community College of Allegheny County. Officers and traffic guards were honored for working 25, 30, 35 or 40 years for the Bureau. The 19 Crossing Guards who were recognized represent 582 years of service to the city, while the 74 officers represent 1,980 years of service to the city. “I am truly honored and blessed to have worked with each of you at one time or another,” Police Chief Scott Schubert said. “The city is blessed to have the likes of you out there protecting us. The work you do, putting your lives on the line each and every day, is truly incredible. … Knowing we have you out there is something I will forever be grateful for as a friend, as a colleague, and as a resident of Pittsburgh.” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich thanked crossing guards for shepherding students to school in all types of weather, and officers for choosing Pittsburgh. “You could have gone elsewhere, you could have taken a job with a suburban police agency likely with more pay and more predictable shifts, but you did not,\" Hissrich said. \"You chose Pittsburgh. You made this your home and vowed to stay here and stand guard. … This is a hard job and often thankless. But you stayed with us. And the city of Pittsburgh is a better place because of you.” Mayor William Peduto thanked Police for being a steadying force through the city's decades-long transformation. “You have been the steady rock that has been the stabilizing force in a city did not know if it had a future let alone what that future may look like,” Peduto said. “You dedicated yourself to one thing -- to serve the public, to keep law and order, to protect the children so that they had a future, and to let people know that they have a city that truly does care about them. I’m here tonight to share two words with you, from the 310,000 people who call this city home and the hundreds of thousands of people who visit this city every day: Thank you.” PITTSBURGH, PA (December 13, 2019) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire held a graduation ceremony today for Recruit Class 129-19, which began its training on April 29, 2019. Of the 31 recruits, four are following in the footsteps of family members. Three of them are the sons of current or retired firefighters and one is the brother of a current firefighter. Sixteen of the recruits are United States military veterans, making them uniquely suited for the many challenges that lie ahead as members of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire. Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Chief Darryl Jones told the class that they are also unique for another reason. “This class, more than any other, exuded the intestinal fortitude, the resiliency, and the can-do attitude that is the fabric of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire,” said Chief Jones. Speaking directly to the families, Chief Jones told them their loved ones were now members of an elite organization, but that their chosen career does not come without sacrifice. He told them there will also be concern for their safety. “Do not worry. They will not be there alone. They will have over 600 of their brothers and sisters right there with them. They will stand with them side by side, back to back, supporting them, encouraging them, and keeping them safe,” said Chief Jones. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich reminded the group that they pushed themselves mentally and physically and gave all they had to give during their 32-week journey to become Pittsburgh Firefighters. But, before administering the Oath of Office, Hissrich told the graduating class that they were also special because they were taught by a legend, Captain James Petruzzi, who will retire next summer. “That means that you, Class 129-19, are his last recruits. Wear that honor proudly. Not only were you taught by the best, but being his last class, he will never forget you. As for you, Captain, I want to personally thank you,” said Hissrich. After being granted the traditional weekend off after graduation by Chief Jones, the newly-minted firefighters will begin work with their platoons at their respective firehouses next week. PITTSBURGH, PA (Dec. 26, 2019) – A Pittsburgh tradition will continue Tuesday, Dec. 31 when the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust hosts “First Night 2020” events at venues throughout Downtown. First Night events always attract large crowds to the Golden Triangle. As such, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich reminds everyone to have fun, but also to be safe and law-abiding. “By working with our partners at the Cultural Trust, the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership and regional law enforcement departments, Pittsburgh Public Safety will be there to assure a safe experience for all,” Hissrich said. “First Night is a special night in Pittsburgh. We’re going to keep it that way. Anyone interested in engaging in illegal activities is advised to just stay home.” Hissrich warned against an unsafe New Year’s Eve tradition in many large cities: Shooting guns into the air. What goes up must come down, and the results are tragic when people are hit by celebratory gunfire. Police will observe ShotSpotter activations throughout the city and officers will arrest anyone caught discharging a firearm in public. Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will work with partnering law enforcement agencies -- including the Pennsylvania State Police, State Park Rangers, Port Authority Police, the Allegheny County Sheriff’s Office and the Allegheny County Police -- to provide uniformed and plainclothes officers throughout First Night venues. The Mounted Unit and River Rescue also will be present. Police urge people to never drink and drive. Officers will be actively looking for impaired drivers. As a reminder, city law prohibits the use of any fireworks, even those that are legal, within 150 feet of a structure. For more information on First Night celebrations, go to firstnightpgh.trustarts.org. PITTSBURGH, PA (Jan. 20, 2020) -- It was with great sadness today that Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich and the entire City of Pittsburgh Public Safety family learned of the passing of former Director Glenn M. Cannon, Esq. “Few people in the history of our city can match Mr. Cannon in terms of contributions to Pittsburgh and Public Safety,” Director Hissrich said. “He was an extraordinary man who lived an exemplary life. His legacy lives on today as the creator and first leader of the city’s EMS department, and in countless other ways. This is a great loss. Glenn Cannon was a great man and a great Pittsburgher.” Mr. Cannon began his Pittsburgh public service career in 1975 when Mayor Pete Flaherty named him to oversee a citywide mobile intensive care/advanced life support ambulance system, which would become the Emergency Medical Services Department. He led the newly-created Pittsburgh EMS from 1975 to 1986. During that time, he established the city’s first River Rescue Unit, first Specialized Rescue Units and the City’s first Hazardous Materials Response Team. “He was a visionary with a keen sense of detail,” said EMS Chief Ron Romano, who was hired by Cannon in 1978. In 1986, Mayor Richard Caliguiri appointed Mr. Cannon to the position of Public Safety Director, a role in which he led nearly 2,700 employees in Police, Fire, EMS, Building Inspection and Administration and 911. He also served as the City’s Emergency Management Coordinator. He served as Public Safety Director until 1992. “He was a great Public Safety Director, very hands on and very active,” Police Chief Scott Schubert said. “This is a loss for his family and friends, and my heart goes out to them. It’s also a loss for Public Safety and the city.” Following his Pittsburgh career, Mr. Cannon worked extensively in emergency management at county, state and federal levels. Director Hissrich, a former EMS medic, worked under Mr. Cannon when he was Public Safety Director. “I personally witnessed his leadership at the Bloomfield Train Derailment in 1987 and the Ashland Oil Spill in 1988 while I was assigned to EMS's Rescue Division as a paramedic,” Hissrich said. “I saw firsthand how he was able to gain control of chaotic situations and ensure that First Responders were able to do their jobs effectively.” Mr. Cannon held degrees from Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon University and Duquesne University. He was a partner in the Pittsburgh law firm of Kennedy, Cannon & DeVinney, an adjunct faculty member and Visiting Senior Lecturer at the University of Pittsburgh, and the author of numerous published professional articles. “Glenn was truly a very good friend, leader, and mentor,” said Assistant Fire Chief Norm Auvil, a longtime friend and colleague of Mr. Cannon. “His vision and inspiration led me to focus on family, education, training and public service. He truly has guided my personal and professional path in life.” On behalf of all in Public Safety, Director Hissrich offers his deepest condolences to Mr. Cannon’s surviving family and friends. PITTSBURGH, PA (Jan. 24, 2020) – Five new regional K9s were sworn into duty at a graduation ceremony at the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police K9 Training Academy. “We’re very fortunate to have the K9 program in the city -- the handlers are just fantastic in what they do,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “Unfortunately, sometimes they give their lives to protect officers and to protect the public. … We appreciate what you do and as long as I’m Public Safety Director, you’ll have my full support for the K9 program.” The ceremony marked the end of an intensive three-month training program at the K9 Academy, where Pittsburgh Police train K9 officers and handlers from agencies throughout Region 13, which includes counties in southwestern Pennsylvania. “I want to thank you for taking a dog and making it your partner, and to them for allowing you to be their partner,” Police Chief Scott Schubert said. “It’s a job that not everybody can do. And sometimes it’s a job that not everybody appreciates because they don’t see the amount of work you do, not just the work itself but at home. It really is a 24/7 job.” Graduates in this class included members of Pittsburgh Police, Butler City Police and the Lawrence County Sheriff’s Department: -- Pittsburgh Police Officer Kevin Foley and K9 Shadow -- Pittsburgh Police Officer Matt Schwartzmiller and K9 Miky -- Butler City Police Lt. Brian Grooms and K9 Chooch -- Butler City Police Patrolman Andrew Niederlander and K9 Rico -- Lawrence County Sheriff’s Deputy John Baldelli and K9 Baki In addition, Pittsburgh Police Officers Kevin Foley, Rich Houck and Kevin Merkel received training certificates to work as K9 instructors. “You’ve all worked very hard, you’ve all overcome your own personal hurdles with your dogs,” said Sgt. William Watts, one of the K9 instructors. “I still remember seeing you guys two weeks in, you were swearing to me you’d never graduate, that it would never come together. I told you if you kept the faith, the hard work would pay off. And here you are.” PITTSBURGH, PA (Jan. 30, 2020) -- The City of Pittsburgh saw significant reductions in several key crime categories in 2019, most notably in homicides. Police officials credited the reductions to several factors, including excellent police work, a focus on community outreach and engagement, the lifesaving work of medics, firefighters and hospitals, partner law enforcement agencies, and the communities and residents we serve. “So many different things go into it,” Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert said. “First and foremost, it’s hard work by our officers. Day in and day out, they amaze me with their work ethic, expertise and professionalism. And day in and day out, they make me proud to be their Chief. Others also deserve credit, including community members, our law enforcement partners at the local, state and federal levels, our amazing medics and hospitals and our community outreach efforts. “But while these numbers are encouraging, at the end of the day even one homicide is too many, one person being shot is too many,” Chief Schubert said. “So we’ll keep working. We won’t be happy until the numbers are even lower.” Homicides in the city dropped 36 percent year-on-year, from 58 in 2018 to 37 in 2019. The drop continues a downward trend over the past five years, and marks the fewest homicides in the city since 1998. In addition, the number of combined non-fatal shooting incidents plus homicides continued to trend downwards for a fourth year in a row: 2016: 253 2017: 187 2018: 163 2019: 146 Assistant Chief Lavonnie Bickerstaff noted that the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police began its transition from reactive policing to evidence-based and intelligence-led policing in 2016. \"This style of policing relies heavily on the Focus Deterrents Model advocated by David Kennedy, who is well known for his work in Boston’s 'Operation Ceasefire,'\" Bickerstaff said. \"This strategic response allows officers to identify and focus on the small groups of individuals who are actively engaged in violence and hold them accountable for their behavior instead of the entire community. When the police, community, and social services are working together and communicating the same message against violent crime, a true reduction in gun violence can be realized.\" There were 1,569 violent crimes citywide, a drop of just 0.8 percent from 2018, but an 18.8 percent drop from the five-year average of 1,932 violent crimes per year. \"Good police work is helping to keep residents safe,\" Major Crimes Commander Victor Joseph said. \"From patrol officers who do excellent work on their beats to detectives who conduct thorough investigations, the men and women of this Bureau deserve credit. Their hard work and expertise is reflected in these numbers.\" Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said the expansion of the ShotSpotter system and security cameras played a big role in reducing crime and saving lives. In 2018, ShotSpotter was expanded from three square miles of coverage to 18 square miles of coverage. ShotSpotter uses a network of acoustic sensors to detect when a gun is fired, and then precisely and quickly pinpoints the location of the gunfire, even if no one calls 911. The cameras allow police to review footage in the area of a shooting, identify suspects -- if not catch the actual crime and actor on camera -- and then track them as they flee. \"As a result of the ShotSpotter system and city-installed security cameras, police are responding immediately to gunfire and locating victims,\" Hissrich said. “By responding faster than ever before, officers are able to render aid to victims who otherwise might die. Every officer carries and is trained to use a tourniquet, and the system combined with Pittsburgh Police’s training and the quick response of our EMS medics is, quite simply, saving lives.” Mayor William Peduto added: “The significant drop in crime the last five years is attributable to the tireless work by our officers, our ongoing dedication to community policing, and continual investments in the Bureau that have resulted in the largest Pittsburgh police force in a generation. On behalf of the City I want to thank police and the entire Pittsburgh community for their ongoing dedication to making us a city for all.” Officials also credited city residents. When the public comes forward with tips, police solve crimes. As a result of increased community engagement, more people are helping police investigations by passing on key information. In addition, police programs aimed at connecting with youth allow officers to be viewed as positive influences who can help young people make constructive life decisions. Group Violence Intervention, a strategy in which police focus their efforts on communities' most violent individuals, is also helping. Through GVI, investigators and citizen outreach workers identify individuals who are most likely to commit a violent crime or become a victim of violent crime and hold custom notifications aimed at helping them escape a dangerous lifestyle. \"The concept is: We want you to live, we want you to stay out of prison, we want you to be a productive member of society and we want to help you get there,\" said Rev. Cornell Jones, who leads GVI outreach teams. \"It’s not just law enforcement. This is a whole village mentality, it’s all of us working together.\" Finally, partner law enforcement agencies contribute in numerous ways, including teaming up to disrupt and dismantle criminal enterprises. Pittsburgh Police has great working relationships with many agencies, including the District Attorney’s Office, US Attorney’s Office, FBI Pittsburgh, University police departments, county law enforcement agencies and neighboring regional agencies. While Police and Public Safety officials are pleased with the downward trends, much work remains. Overall crime rates Downtown dropped by 6 percent, but violent crime Downtown increased from 119 cases in 2018 to 136 cases in 2019. Police have added patrols to the Golden Triangle, and plan to staff the Downtown Substation around the clock. Also of concern: Ethnic Intimidation cases increased from 17 total incidents (6 involving violence) in 2018 to 22 total incidents (11 involving violence). Pittsburgh Police have made it a priority to build bridges with every community and resident in the City of Pittsburgh. We will not tolerate hatred against anyone. The increase in ethic intimidation cases mirror national averages, but Pittsburgh Police will continue to combat hate crime in all forms. “We have focused on precision policing through our data-driven policing efforts,” Commander Eric Holmes said. “At the heart of our work is building bridges to the community. We are seeing the fruits of our labor.” Dr. Heath Johnson and the PBP Crime Analysis Team have compiled the following statistical data. More statistics will be released in the forthcoming Annual Report. PITTSBURGH, PA (February 3, 2020) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is pleased to announce a donation from Allegheny Health Network (AHN) to provide city officers with life-saving hemostatic gauze, bolstering preparedness in response to traumatic injuries in the field. NuStat Tactical is a sterile dressing that is applied to trauma wounds to control bleeding and prevent infection until a patient can be transported to the hospital. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich says expanding the distribution of this product to police officers is another important tool in an officer's toolkit. “Police officers have already saved numerous lives using tourniquets and other equipment at their disposal, so providing a wider distribution of these types of tools can help save even more lives. Similar to things like Narcan, the more it’s out there in the field, the more likely we are to save lives,” said Hissrich. AHN has provided 1,000 NuStat gauze packages, which have now been issued to every Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officer. The single-use dressing is already used widely by EMS, the military, and hospitals and can serve as a valuable, life-saving instrument for both officers and civilians in the event of a traumatic injury. \"Uncontrolled bleeding can result in death in five minutes or fewer,\" said Allie Quick, Chief Philanthropy Officer, AHN. \"Similar to how the general public learns and performs CPR, learning proper bleeding control techniques, including how to use your hands, dressings and tourniquets, can be life-saving knowledge in an emergency situation. We are grateful to work so closely with our police force to ensure that our city is as prepared as possible to respond to emergencies.\" PITTSBURGH, PA (Feb. 27, 2020) – The City of Pittsburgh’s Public Safety Department continues to prepare for a possible outbreak of Coronavirus in the region. Although no cases have been reported here -- the closest reported U.S. case is in Boston -- Public Safety plans for all possibilities at all times. As such, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich began holding regular meetings to address Coronavirus concerns in early January. Those meetings continue. Public Safety’s readiness plans include updating the city’s 2014 Pandemic operational plan, which has been completed. As part of that update, contingency plans were added to ensure additional EMS personnel and units if necessary. In addition, First Responders have been trained to identify possible cases of Coronavirus, and to take steps to provide medical care or isolate patients if necessary. As part of that training, First Responders were provided with enhanced personal protection kits that contain face masks, gloves, hand sanitizers and protective eyewear to be worn in the event they encounter someone with the virus. To achieve operational readiness, the city is checking all EMS vehicles, including ambulances, to ensure they are working properly. City officials have also reached out to local hospitals and Allegheny County and suburban public safety officials to coordinate preparedness and response plans. Citizens can do their part in simple ways, most importantly by washing their hands often. “This is about being prepared,” Director Hissrich said. “While we are pleased that no cases have appeared in this area yet, we will be ready if any cases do appear here. We prepare for any and all types of threats, whether it be flooding concerns, large snowfalls, extreme heat, large gatherings in the city or Presidential and dignitary visits. We always prepare, and we’ll be prepared for this as well.” For more information on national efforts to address the Coronavirus, go to www.cdc.gov. (First Responder Personal Protection Kits) PITTSBURGH, PA (March 9, 2020) - On Monday, March 9, the Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS held a swearing-in and promotions ceremony in City of Pittsburgh Council Chambers. Six new paramedics were sworn in, while two paramedics were promoted to the position of crew chief. Alexander Atkinson, Ian Leong, Ken Long, Isaac Nadoff, Jennifer Pollock, and Michael Simcic were sworn in as new paramedics, while Fred Caprio II and Christy Zalewski were promoted and sworn in as crew chiefs. EMS Chief Ronald Romano congratulated the group and acknowledged the role of their families and friends in helping them perform their jobs at an elite level. \"Thank you for being here for them and supporting them in the work they do for the citizens of Pittsburgh. I thank you for sharing them with us and understanding when they miss a family event because they are out helping someone else,\" said Romano. He also thanked the EMS crews who were out on the streets working so the paramedics and crew chiefs could be sworn in today. Associate Medical Director Dr. Vince Mosesso of Pittsburgh EMS recognized the new paramedics and those promoted to crew chief, noting that just four decades ago, the men and women of Pittsburgh EMS were pioneers in what was a new and emerging field of emergency medical services. \"Today the men and women of Pittsburgh EMS are leaders on the forefront of a new evolution in EMS. Today we recognize that EMS sits at the intersection of public safety, public health and healthcare. There is an increasing appreciation of the role of EMS in an integrated healthcare system,\" said Mosesso. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich reminded the new paramedics and crew chiefs that they represent the City, that they should treat patients the way they would treat their own family members, and to always take time for themselves and their families. Before administering the oath of office, Hissrich acknowledged that the group, along with the entire Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS, could, in the coming weeks, be on the front lines of a new challenge with the coronavirus. Hissrich said, \"As we go down that path, we will learn day to day things that we should have done, or that we do correctly, for people who follow us who may be in the same situation. For that, ahead of time, I thank you. It may very well entail being away from your families more than what you expected when you signed up.\" PITTSBURGH, PA (March 12, 2020) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police held a promotions ceremony today in the City of Pittsburgh Council Chambers. Four sergeants were promoted to the rank of lieutenant, while three officers were promoted to the rank of sergeant. Istvan Devenyi, Eric Kroll, Thomas Gault and Philip Mercurio were promoted to the rank of lieutenant. Jonathan Craig, Jordan Loscar and Brian Marckisotto were promoted to the rank of sergeant. Police Chief Scott Schubert acknowledged the hard work and dedication the officers have put in over the years and thanked them for taking this next step in their careers. “You’ve given yourself to the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and to this calling of being a police officer,\" Schubert said. \"These are tough times. It’s not an easy job. There’s a lot of stress, there’s a lot of danger, but each day you get up and put your uniform on and you go out and help the residents of the City of Pittsburgh and the people who are visiting our city. \"The officers are going to have questions and concerns. They’re going to look to you for answers, they’re going to look to you for guidance.” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich told the group that they serve with the selfless desire to protect others and aid our communities. “I’m very impressed with your level of devotion and dedication to the City,\" Hissrich said. \"I thank you for your distinctive service and congratulate you on your well-deserved honor. I thank the family members for their sacrifice, for their understanding of the roles these officers play in the protection of the city we all love.” Mayor William Peduto noted that the new sergeants and lieutenants are now on the front lines of helping people in a challenging time for Pittsburgh, and the world, as it confronts a global pandemic with COVID-19. Peduto reminded them that their knowledge and experience will be indispensible to the officers they guide. “Remember this, that as you go home each night, think about the officers that you are leading and making sure that they have the opportunity to go home each night as well, safe, secure, and with sound guidance from you,” said Peduto. PITTSBURGH, PA (March 13, 2020) — Despite the cancellation of the annual St. Patrick’s Day parade, the City of Pittsburgh’s Public Safety Department is prepared for celebrations and large localized crowds tomorrow. With serious COVID-19 concerns, this year’s holiday will be different than past years. Some things, however, will not change — including Public Safety’s determination to catch anyone drinking and driving. “With COVID-19 and the cancellation of the parade, we anticipate lighter crowds than years past,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “But we will still maintain a zero tolerance policy for disruptive and illegal behavior. Underage drinking and drinking and driving in particular will be targeted. We want people to enjoy themselves, but to do so responsibly.” Pittsburgh Bureau of Police DUI Patrols will actively seek anyone who drives under the influence. Plan ahead, use Lyft, Uber and Z-Trip, and never drive while under the influence or get in a vehicle with a driver who is intoxicated. Pittsburgh Police will also have undercover officers and uniformed officers targeting law-breakers. State, County and City Mounted Units will be deployed, and River Rescue will be active on the waterways. State Police, County Police, the Sheriff’s Department and police agencies from local universities and other public safety partners will be out as well. Be mindful of pedestrian safety. Wearlight-colored clothing so motorists can see you. Don’t wear headphones while walking. Be aware of your surroundings. In addition this year — and in light of COVID-19 concerns — focus on personal hygiene and social distancing. Wash your hands regularly, do not share drinks, and maintain personal space of at least six feet from others. Public Safety understands that social distancing will be a challenge in bar or restaurant settings, which is why officials are urging businesses to lower their occupancy rates and give people more space. Police, firefighters and inspectors from Permits, Licenses and Inspections will be on the ground, strictly enforcing occupancy maximums. PITTSBURGH, PA (April 1, 2020) — A Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire firefighter today tested positive for COVID-19. The firefighter began experiencing flu-like symptoms on March 27 and has not worked since the day before, March 26. The firefighter is on self-isolation at home. Officials have identified seven firefighters who came into contact with the firefighter on March 26. All seven firefighters have been instructed to self-quarantine at home. None are showing symptoms. Fire officials are checking in daily with the firefighter who tested positive and the seven firefighters on self-quarantine. Equipment and gear the firefighter used is being thoroughly cleaned. For privacy reasons, Public Safety is not releasing the name or work location of the firefighter. PITTSBURGH, PA (April 6, 2020) — A Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officer has tested positive for COVID-19. The officer started exhibiting flu-like symptoms on April 1 and was sent home. On April 2, the officer was tested. The results came back positive on April 4. The officer is in self-isolation at home. The officer is an instructor with the Police Academy and was recently in contact with recruits. Police officials are in the process of identifying and notifying everyone who had contact with the officer and placing them in self-quarantine. All equipment and gear the officer used has been thoroughly cleaned. Officials are checking in daily with the officer. For privacy reasons, Public Safety is not releasing the officer's name. UPDATE: The following is a statement from Chief Scott Schubert on the positive test of a PBP officer: “The safety and well-being of our officers is always a top priority for me and my Command Staff, but officer health is especially important now as the men and women of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police are on the front lines of this battle day in and day out. Simply put, for us to help the public, we need officers to be healthy. “For that reason, and out of an abundance of caution, we have temporarily suspended a 28-person recruit class as we identify who among them might have been exposed to a firearms instructor that has tested positive for COVID-19. Any exposure would have occurred at the outdoor Police firing range in Zone 5 and not in the Academy. “We’ve made several adjustments as we face this virus, including the suspension of all in-service training more than three weeks ago. We suspended the training of a new recruit class, but continued the training of this class because they were close to satisfying their training requirements. The class was isolated from other officers and was instructed to maintain social distancing. It is not known where the officer who tested positive contracted the virus. We have instructed numerous recruits who might have come into contact with him at the range to self-quarantine, and we will be monitoring their health daily. Anyone who shows symptoms will be tested. At this time, one recruit has shown symptoms and has been tested, but the results are not in yet. “These are stressful times. And First Responders simply cannot work from home. I stand in awe of my officers for the way they have dedicated themselves to our communities during this most difficult time.” A statement from Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich on the positive test: “We are taking every possible preventative measure to ensure the safety of all our First Responders. But we are dealing with an unprecedented and unpredictable threat. This is our first officer to test positive, and the second member of Public Safety after a firefighter tested positive last week. Hopefully we will have no more positive tests. But as we have seen in other cities, First Responders are often deeply impacted by this virus.” PITTSBURGH, PA (April 8, 2020) - All City of Pittsburgh staff working in the field and having contact with the public will be issued protective masks, following recommendations issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Governor Tom Wolf. Residents will soon see masks being worn by police, firefighters, paramedics, Animal Care & Control officers, Park Rangers, and personnel from the departments of Public Works, Mobility and Infrastructure, Permits Licenses and Inspections, and Parks and Recreation. “We’ve got to model this practice for everybody else,” Police Chief Scott Schubert said. “If everyone does their part and wears a mask, we might be able to stop this virus even quicker.” The masks do not prevent the person wearing them from contracting the virus, but they do help reduce the amount of potentially infectious droplets expelled by the wearer, thereby protecting anyone the mask-wearer encounters. Public Safety and other City of Pittsburgh staff are using the masks to protect First Responders and the public. We all have a part to play in this battle, and we will not waver until COVID-19 is defeated. #HereForYou412 PITTSBURGH, PA (April 17, 2020)—A Pittsburgh Firefighter who tested positive for COVID-19 has recovered from the virus and returned to work. The firefighter began experiencing flu-like symptoms on March 27 and immediately went into self-isolation at home. The firefighter tested positive for COVID-19 on April 1, but never required hospitalization. Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire officials identified seven other firefighters who came into contact with the firefighter on March 26 and placed them on self-quarantine at home. None of them developed symptoms. They also returned to work. Over the past week, two additional Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officials tested positive for the virus, including a recruit and an officer. Police have had six total positive tests. One officer required hospitalization but is improving and hopes to be released soon. All others were placed on self-isolation. Contact-tracing has been conducted in all cases. Police Command Staff is in daily contact with the officers and their families. No one from EMS, Animal Care & Control or Emergency Management has tested positive for the virus. “Other departments have seen 10, 15, even 20 percent of their personnel become ill, but we have so far avoided anything like that,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “This virus is volatile and dangerous, but we have implemented numerous measures that we hope will continue to keep our numbers as low as possible.” In addition to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), Public Safety personnel have been issued masks to be worn at all times while in public. First Responders’ are screened before entering facilities and anyone with a fever or any other symptom is sent home. In addition, social distancing is being observed at all times possible. One Environmental Services worker sadly died of COVID-19 this week. A second employee who tested positive has not yet returned to work. Note: The numbers of personnel being tested, self-isolations, self-quarantines and other COVID-19-related actions fluctuate daily, and as such Public Safety and the City will provide weekly updates on positive tests but cannot accommodate daily inquiries. PITTSBURGH, PA (May 19, 2020) -- During National Emergency Medical Services Week, the Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS received recogntion today from the Pennsylvania Emergency Health Services Council for its ongoing commitment to delivering high-quality pediatric emergency care in the City of Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS completed Pennsylvania's Pediatric Voluntary Recognition Program (PVRP) to ensure that all children receive the best possible prehospital emergency care. The multi-faceted program requires EMS agencies to complete five requirements that build from the basic to the expert level. The Council's EMS for Children Program Manager, Duane Spencer, recognized the Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS for its successful completion of the expert level. EMS Chief Ron Romano received the offical certification on behalf of the Bureau, calling it a great honor. \"Many thanks to the paramedics who are out there doing this every day and making this accomplishment happen and for making us all proud,\" said Romano. EMS District Chief Jeffrey Meyer was also recognized as the program's Pediatric Emergency Care Coordinator who will assist the Bureau in preparing for calls for service involving pediatric patients through ongoing education and training, quality improvement, community engagement and preparedness, and clinical care. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich acknowledged the evolution of Pittsburgh EMS over the years, as it improves on skills with thousands of hours of advanced training to include things like pediatric care. Hissrich said, \"I think it's very important that we've expanded our role not only from the response by EMS, but to prevention, and hopefully that will continue.\" Mayor William Peduto congratulated the Bureau on its accomplishment and acknowledged its integral role in the City's world class medical community. \"Our EMS Bureau is viewed on a global basis. People travel in from around the world in order to be able to be trained by Pittsburgh EMS. That type of recognition is only enhanced by the recognition of today from the Department of Health,\" said Peduto. PITTSBURGH, PA (May 29, 2020)—The following is a message Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Chief Scott Schubert sent bureau-wide at 6 a.m. today. Public Safety is releasing it publicly in response to questions from the public and media about PBP’s response to the tragic and senseless death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Colleagues, I'm certain many of you have by now viewed the video of George Floyd’s in-custody death in Minneapolis on May 25. Like you, I was deeply disturbed and saddened by what I saw. This is not how we are trained to restrain people and it's not what we stand for as police officers. Regardless of the original crime or what occurred prior to the arrest, a person in handcuffs and face-down on the ground should not lose their life due to the action or inaction of the involved officers. It was difficult to watch Mr. Floyd pleading for help and gasping for breath before saying his final words—all while pedestrians frantically pleaded with officers to help him. I simply cannot comprehend the actions of the officers or their lack of moral courage and duty to intervene and stop the action before it was too late. My prayers are with Mr. Floyd and his family during this most difficult time. As police officers, we have a fundamental duty to care for and safeguard everyone and anyone in our custody. That did not occur with this particular incident. A man was deprived of his life, a family wasdeprivedof their loved one, a community wasdeprivedof their faith in the people who are entrusted to keep them safe and our noble profession wasdeprivedof its legitimacy by the incomprehensible and senseless actions of a few.There was no consideration for the value of human life and that is inexcusable. These officers don’t represent any of us in law enforcement and must face the consequences for their actions! We are better than this. We must continue to do what's right. I'm thankful for the men and women of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. I know the high level of training each of you have received and I know firsthand the high level of professionalism, bravery, courage and compassion our officers display on a daily basis. We have sworn an oath and I trust that all of us will use our moral courage to intervene when we see something wrong. We owe it to each another, we owe it to our noble profession and we owe it to the community we protect and serve. I have asked the Academy to review this senseless death and share additional information that can help reinforce our training and policies. Excessive force is unacceptable and will not be tolerated at any level. Thank you for your commitment to selfless service. Please stay safe and healthy! Scott Chief Scott E. Schubert City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police PITTSBURGH, PA (July 3, 2019) —The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police today posted online the 2019 Annual Report. “As part of our commitment to transparency, we encourage members of the community to explore every aspect of the report to learn as much as possible about our bureau and our efforts to keep our communities safe while serving the public with a high level of professionalism, courage, integrity, respect and compassion,” Police Chief Scott E. Schubert stated in the Annual Report introduction. “Our goal continues to strive to be reflective of the communities that we serve.” The report includes statistics, including a 36% drop in homicides, and details ongoing efforts by Group Violence Intervention, plus homeless empathy and resource training for all recruits at the academy. Chief Schubert also reflects on the loss off Officer Calvin Hall. “The Bureau of Police faced a Line of Duty death with the passing of Officer Calvin Hall on July 17, 2019,” Chief Schubert observed. “Calvin’s service to the City of Pittsburgh will never be forgotten.” Anyone interested in joining the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is invited to visit Join Pittsburgh Police. “We are extremely excited with the direction we are headed,” Schubert said. “We value our partnerships with the communities we serve, and we recognize that we will not be successful without support from the communities we serve. We take seriously our responsibility of protecting the citizens of Pittsburgh.

The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, in partnership with multiple local agencies and the general public, has launched investigations into individuals within that small group—people who have attacked journalists, looted businesses, caused property damage and committed other crimes. The unified body overseeing these investigations—the Damage Assessment & Accountability Task Force (DAAT)—was formed today. This multi-agency team, comprised of local, state, and federal partners, has begun interviewing witnesses and victims of crime and assessing all property damage related to the protests. They are analyzing digital evidence gathered from police body worn cameras, City cameras and all available private CCTV footage. \"I would like to thank all of the law enforcement agencies participating in the task force. Together we are committed to locating and holding those responsible for the damage and violence that occurred in our city,\" said Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert. Members of the public can also help. Anyone wishing to share videos, photographs, or information can send it to DAAT@Pittsburghpa.gov. Contributors will remain anonymous. PITTSBURGH, PA (June 5, 2020)—The majority of the recent protests in the City of Pittsburgh have been peaceful, with only a small group of people intent on causing destruction. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, in partnership with multiple local agencies and the general public, has launched investigations into individuals within that small group—people who have attacked journalists, looted business, caused property damage and committed other crimes such as arson. The unified body overseeing these investigations—the Damage Assessment and Accountability Taskforce (DAAT)—was formed earlier this week. In connection to this taskforce, police arrested Matthew Michanowicz, 52, of Duquesne Heights after police recovered a backpack with homemade explosives on Monday. After reviewing security camera footage, investigators determined Michanowicz placed the bag there on Sunday and then left. Pittsburgh Police are working in conjunction with federal investigators on the case. “The DAAT will continue to review previous intelligence indicating past violence against property, journalists, private citizens and law enforcement,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “That intelligence includes online threats to damage and loot businesses, and detailed instructions on how to make a Molotov cocktail. These threats are real: On Saturday, a protester threw an improvised incendiary device at a Pittsburgh Police Officer near Mellon Square, which exploded on the ground and caused a nearby officer to suffer concussion-like symptoms. Police are actively investigating.” The taskforce is also investigating the looting and/or vandalism of dozens of businesses in the city, and assaults on at least five journalists. The City, Public Safety and Police Bureau have long held as a guiding principle the belief that all people have a fundamental right to protest peacefully, as is guaranteed by the First Amendment. Police will monitor all protests, try to anticipate the group’s movement and then close roadways in advance of the protesters in order to keep them safe. Law enforcement intervenes only when violence occurs and a gathering has been deemed unlawful. At that time, orders to disperse are issued. DAAT is a multi-agency team comprised of local, state, and federal Law Enforcement partners, to include: Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office, Allegheny County Police, Allegheny County Sheriff’s Department, Pennsylvania Attorney General’s Office, Pennsylvania State Police, FBI Pittsburgh, the US Attorneys Office and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The taskforce is interviewing witnesses and victims of crime and assessing all property damage related to the protests. They are analyzing digital evidence gathered from police body worn cameras, City cameras and all available private CCTV footage. More arrests are pending. Members of the public can also help. Anyone wishing to share videos, photographs, or information can send it to DAAT@Pittsburghpa.gov, or call (412) 323-7800 and ask for the taskforce. Contributors will remain anonymous. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich swore in seven new paramedics during a ceremony on the North Shore this morning. “These are challenging times for Public Safety and the city,” Hissrich said. “But I know you are up to those challenges ahead.” Benjamin Bowman, Emon Ismail, Matthew Lederman, Emily Migdal, Joseph Mahoney, Zachary Saylor and Nissa Thomsen were all sworn in before Hissrich, EMS Chief Ron Romano, City Medical Director Ron Roth, colleagues, friends and family during the ceremony. \"Thank you to the families,” Romano said. “Thank you for being here for them and supporting them in the work they do and for sharing them with us. And thank you to the EMS crews working today so we can all be here.” The event was held outside, rather than Council Chambers, so as to properly maintain physical distancing. Please join us in welcoming Pittsburgh’s newest First Responders. PITTSBURGH, PA (June 26, 2020)—Pittsburghers love Fourth of July fireworks shows. But with public shows cancelled this year due to Covid-19 concerns, many people across the city are conducting private shows in neighborhoods citywide. Indeed, from June 1 to June 21, Pittsburgh Police received 137 fireworks complaint calls—a 389 percent increase over the 28 calls received over the same period last year. While this spike is also occurring in cities across the country, Public Safety officials remind local residents and visitors that consumer fireworks—even those that were recently legalized—pose significant dangers to people and property, and that fireworks can almost never be set off legally inside city limits. “As a Pittsburgh native myself, I understand that fireworks are an important part of the way we celebrate our Independence Day,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “Unfortunately, as a result of the ongoing battle against the deadly Coronavirus, all fireworks and public gatherings have been cancelled this year. Please remember that fireworks are a real fire hazard and can be very dangerous. I urge everyone to exercise caution this year and not use them.” To address the illegal use of fireworks in city neighborhoods, a Fireworks Taskforce made up of Pittsburgh Police and Fire Investigators was formed this week. The taskforce will patrol city nieghborhoods and respond to 911 calls for illegal fireworks. City law prohibits the use of fireworks, even those that are legal, within 150 feet of any structure. Fireworks are also prohibited in all parks, any public space and on private property without consent of the landowner. Anyone caught violating fireworks law is subject to a $100 fine and the possible seizure of their fireworks. “Fireworks are not safe, especially in the hands of children,” Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire’s Fire Prevention Officer Lisa Epps-Cuda said. “Not even sparklers are safe. Think about it: Water boils at 212 degrees, wood burns at 575 degrees, glass melts at 900 degrees and sparklers burn at 1,200 degrees. Why would you put something like that in the hands of a child?” PITTSBURGH, PA (July 1, 2020)—The Fourth of July, like everything else these days, will take on a different look and feel this year. As a result of the ongoing global pandemic, there will be no City-sponsored fireworks show, no mass gatherings at the Point or North Shore, and no alcohol consumption at bars Downtown, in the Southside or anywhere else in the county. As such, Public Safety’s approach this year will also change. Pittsburgh Police and several partner law enforcement agencies will still be out on Saturday, but rather than assuring safety for large crowds of revelers, they will seek to counsel people not adhering to proper physical distancing or public mask-wearing, instructing any large groups that do assemble to disperse, and enforcing laws. “This is certainly going to be a unique Independence Day in Pittsburgh, and not necessarily in a positive way,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “We all know that these are uncertain and trying times. But if we can pull together as a city and each of us do our part to keep ourselves and our neighbors safe, hopefully we can come together as a city next year and have a Fourth of July celebration that no one will ever forget.” Director Hissrich, EMS Chief Ron Romano, Fire Chief Darryl Jones and Police Chief Scott Schubert provide the following safety tips for this year’s holiday weekend: —Do not use fireworks illegally. Although some consumer fireworks were recently legalized, they remain a fire hazard and safety concern. As a reminder, fireworks are not allowed in Point State Park or any City park. In addition, the use of any fireworks, even those that are legal, are prohibited within 150 feet of any structure, on any public land and on private property without the landowner’s permission. Due to a dramatic surge in fireworks complaints, Public Safety formed a Fireworks Taskforce to patrol city neighborhoods and target anyone using fireworks illegally. For more information, follow this link to the taskforce press release: https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4096 —Do not fire guns in the air. Celebratory gunfire is dangerous and, frankly, stupid. But it remains a problem in many cities, particularly on the Fourth of July and New Year’s Eve. Bullets fired into the air must come down, and when they do the results can be deadly. Pittsburgh Police in all six zones will respond to ShotSpotter activations and arrest anyone caught firing a gun in public. —Practice water safety. With City pools closed, some residents will take to private pools and rivers to swim. These options carry significant risk as there is typically not a qualified life guard on duty. River Rescue, the Fire Boat and the Coast Guard will be on the city’s three rivers to enforce boating laws and teach water safety. —Follow pandemic guidelines. Maintain proper physical distancing. Wear a mask. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds often. Avoid large crowds. Stay home if you’re not feeling well. In other words, all of the advice health experts have been repeating for months, follow them. Allegheny County is experiencing a spike in new Covid-19 cases. We can reverse this trend, but only if we follow the experts’ advice. —Prepare for heat. The Fourth of July traditionally brings heat and humidity, and this year will be no different. Temperatures are forecast to be above 90 for many days in a row. Limit alcohol intake and drink plenty of water. —Do not drink and drive. Ever. Patrols will be out actively searching for and arresting impaired drivers. When it comes to drinking and driving, Public Safety has a zero-tolerance policy. —Remember your pets. Please keep them in a safe place. Many dogs are panicked by fireworks and will run away when they hear them. Animal Care & Control sees an increase in lost pets every year in the weeks leading up to the Fourth of July. Again, we understand that 2020 has been challenging on multiple fronts and that this year’s celebrations will necessarily be different. Let’s all keep a level head during these strange days, with the understanding that our best days as a city are ahead of us. Public Safety thanks you and wishes all a happy, albeit muted, Fourth of July. PITTSBURGH, PA (July 3, 2020) -- As we head into the Independence Day weekend, last night kept the Fireworks Taskforce extremely busy with a total of 85 fireworks complaint calls across all six police zones. Three of those calls proved to be another strong reminder of the dangers of fireworks in the City. At around 11 p.m. taskforce members warned a group of people shooting off fireworks from the baseball field at Horace Mann School on the 2800 block of Shadeland Avenue to stop and clean up their debris. About 40 minutes later the roof of the abandoned school was discovered to be on fire. Firefighters battled and put out the 2-alarm blaze that caused an estimated $50,000 to $60,000 damage. Another incident resulted in an injury. A firework was thrown into the gym at McNaugher School in the 2600 block of Maple Street during a dance class. One juvenile female received a minor burn to her foot. Earlier in the day, a large brush fire on Rose Street in the Hill District was extinguished before it could spread to any structures or cause injuries. That fire was also believed to have been caused by fireworks. These incidents are being investigated. There are no arrests at this time, but anyone with information is urged to call the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police at (412) 323-7800. State law prohibits the use of fireworks, even those that are legal, within 150 feet of any structure. Fireworks are also prohibited in all parks, any public space, and on private property without consent of the landowner. Anyone caught violating fireworks law is subject to a $100 fine and the possible seizure of their fireworks. The Fireworks Task Force would also like people to know that the release of sky lanterns is illegal. \"We at Public Safety know this Fourth of July weekend is not the kind Pittsburghers are used to. It's frustrating that we can't gather and celebrate with our usual, grand fireworks display that everyone can enjoy,\" Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. \"Many people will be tempted to put on their own displays, but I urge them to refrain and celebrate in other ways in order to stay safe during these challenging times.\" PITTSBURGH, PA (July 17, 2020) — The following is a statement from the family of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Officer Calvin Hall: “It has been one year since our loved one was abruptly taken from us, and not a day goes by that we do not mourn him. The pain is just as present today as it was a year ago. His death represents so many others who are gone too soon, gone due to the unnecessary violence that continues to plague our communities. “We are still trying to process what happened and why. But we remain in constant hope that justice will be served, not only for Calvin but for all who have lost their lives at the hands of others due to ignorance, hatred, and prejudice. “The Hall Family would like to thank the Pittsburgh Police and the city of Pittsburgh for standing in solidarity to combat racial inequities. We would also like to thank Mayor William Peduto, Braddock Police, Point Park University Police, and the Housing Authority for keeping Calvin’s legacy alive. “We are keeping everyone in our thoughts and prayers during these trying times. Thank you, and be safe.” Officer Hall was shot in the early morning hours of July 14, 2019. He died from his injuries July 17, 2019. As the investigation is ongoing, Pittsburgh Police will have no further comment on his murder. But we will continue to pray for Officer Hall’s family, and to be ever thankful that the PBP was blessed, albeit briefly, with Calvin’s presence. PITTSBURGH, PA, (July 29, 2020) – For the third year running, the Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS was honored with the American Heart Association’s 2020 Mission: Lifeline EMS Gold Plus Performance Achievement Award; the highest level. The distinction recognizes the outstanding level of critical care Paramedics and EMTs provide to cardiac and stroke patients. “This is another great accomplishment achieved once again by our City’s EMS Bureau,\" Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “To be able to maintain and provide the highest quality care for the residents and visitors to Pittsburgh is a reflection of the training, advanced skills, and technology that the Paramedics and EMTs utilize every day throughout the city. Congratulations.\" According to the American Heart Association, this elite status distinction signifies that Pittsburgh EMS applies “the most up-to-date and evidence-based treatment guidelines to improve patient care and outcomes in the community you serve.” “This is the fourth year in a row Pittsburgh EMS has received the award and the third year straight that it received the Gold Plus standing, thanks to the meticulous work performed by Pittsburgh EMS personnel each day,” said Pittsburgh EMS Chief Ronald Romano. Assistant EMS Chief Mark Pinchalk noted that Pittsburgh EMS achieved this honor while also managing the challenges of an ongoing global pandemic. “We are going through tough times at the moment, but take a minute and enjoy your accomplishment,” said Pinchalk. PITTSBURGH, PA (August 21, 2020) -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is implementing changes to incident command during the ongoing protests in the City.

PITTSBURGH, PA (September 30, 2020) - The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and Global Links are winding down their successful campaign to help protect Pittsburgh residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since May, more than 100,000 free masks have been distributed to residents through the, “Need a Mask, Take a Mask” initiative. Protective cloth masks were made available at all six Pittsburgh Police zones and two substations, placed inside newspaper boxes on loan from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the Tribune-Review. Additional masks were also handed out with Grab and Go lunches at Citiparks – City of Pittsburgh Department of Parks and Recreation senior and recreation centers and to 70 other community partners. This innovative collaboration was made possible thanks to Global Links, which donated the masks to the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police in an effort to help community members comply with Governor Tom Wolf’s facemask order and flatten the curve at the height of the pandemic. “Pittsburgh Police jumped at the chance to collaborate with Global Links, a renowned medical relief and development organization that repurposes surplus resources to meet local and international needs,” said Pittsburgh Police Sergeant Tiffany Kline-Costa. “Through this initiative we were able to help play a small part in safeguarding our communities and educating our neighbors about the importance of protective mask use during COVID-19. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is grateful for this partnership and we hope residents will continue to stay safe and healthy.” When the current supply of masks runs out at Pittsburgh Police zone locations, they will not be replenished. Pittsburgh Police would like to thank Global Links, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and the Tribune-Review for making this program a success. PITTSBURGH, PA (October 2, 2020) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire is pleased to announce that it has completed training to become recognized as a Type-3A swift water and flood response team by the Pennsylvania Department of Health, Bureau of Emergency Medical Services and the Office of the State Fire Commissioner. Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Chief Darryl Jones began putting together a swift water rescue team shortly after a severe rain storm caused flash flooding along Washington Boulevard in August 2011, killing four people. “We were not prepared at that time and now we are prepared. We’ve been working toward this certification that now recognizes the technician-level training our teams have achieved and officially states that we meet the standard to perform this task, this rescue, this duty,” said Jones. Under the guidance of Chief Jones, Captain Patrick Shaw with Engine Truck 17 has headed up the training program over the past eight years. “Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire is on PEMA’s radar now. If a hurricane comes through the Eastern part of the state, PEMA can request our Type 3-A team. We’re actually providing a better service to the citizens, they pay their taxes and we’re here to give them a better service. We are trained at the technician level and a top notch rescue team is what they have now.” said Shaw. Thirty-eight firefighters are trained and certified at the technician level, split between two separate squads. The Type-3A certification makes the teams a regional asset deployable outside of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County for flash flood and disaster response. PITTSBURGH, PA, (October 6, 2020) --- The Department of Public Safety is thrilled to announce that Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Officer Timothy Matson has returned to work this week on modified duty. Officer Matson was shot and seriously injured during the tragic attack inside the Tree of Life Synagogue that killed 11 people on October 27, 2018. Since that time, Officer Matson has undergone extensive rehabilitation to ensure his return to the profession he loves. “Tim said from day one that he would be back. He’s worked extremely hard over the last two years to make this a reality and we couldn’t be prouder or more thankful to Tim and all who stood by his side during this incredible journey. If anyone was going to do this, after everything he’s been through, I knew Tim could,\" said Police Chief Scott Schubert. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich called Matson’s return to work a, “A bright spot to emerge from a dark chapter in the City’s history.” \"Officer Matson is a model of selflessness and dedication to others, and a great example of the public service police officers and other city employees provide to Pittsburgh residents every day,\" Mayor William Peduto said. Welcome back Officer Matson! N.B. Understandably there is great interest in Officer Matson’s return, but Public Safety would like to remind people to refrain from directly contacting any of its personnel. All inquiries must be directed to the Public Information Office at PIO@pittsburghpa.gov. PITTSBURGH, PA (October 14, 2020) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Emergency Medical Services held an outdoor awards, swearing-in and promotions ceremony today beside the Law Enforcement Officers Memorial on the North Shore. Michael McClintock and Tyler Woeppel were sworn in as new Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs). Thomas Brungo, Brianna Kramer, Katsiaryna Lohinava, Emma Owings, Alyse Saylor, and Suzanne Schwebel were sworn in as new Paramedics. Anthony Cugini was promoted from EMT to Paramedic and Crew Chief Anthony Shrader was promoted to District Chief. EMS Chief Ronald Romano congratulated the group and thanked their families and friends for supporting them as they advance in their careers with Pittsburgh EMS. “Thank you for sharing them with us and understanding when they miss a family event because they are helping someone else,” Romano said. Medical Director Dr. Ronald Roth acknowledged how a global pandemic has created new challenges for EMS personnel in the field, while providing a new, heightened level of protection for everyone. “There’s never been a more challenging time to be a pre-hospital care provider. Working at home is not an option for you and wearing a mask is not a political statement. It’s a way of keeping you safe, your families safe, and our patients safe,” said Dr. Roth. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich congratulated the group on their accomplishments and told them that one of the most important services Pittsburgh EMS personnel can provide is compassion. “Whether or not it’s basic life support or advanced life support, you always need to remember that it might be the first time that a member of the public is calling for a medic unit or an EMT unit. What you do during your patient care time, they may remember the rest of their lives,” said Hissrich. Mayor William Peduto administered the Oath of Office for the new and newly-promoted members, reminding them that they’re part of an organization of leaders, but also part of a team that will be there for them so they can be there for the people of Pittsburgh. “You’ll be in the situation where people will be relying upon you, so you will have to rely upon each other. You’ll be in the situation where people will be at the darkest moment of their life, in the moment where they don’t know whether they’ll be able to take another breath…and they’re going to rely upon you to make sure that they do,” said Peduto. As part of the ceremony, District Chief Mike Rogers presented paramedics Romayne Bendig and Taylor Mahoney with the District Chief’s Award for their actions in rescuing a woman who was struck by a vehicle and trapped underneath. The Meritorious Service Medal was awarded to Crew Chief Christy Zalewski for consistently demonstrating outstanding acts of service that reflect rare and exceptional character and an uncommon degree of concern for the well-being of others. PITTSBURGH, PA (October 21, 2020) – Pittsburgh Public Safety continues to take the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic extremely seriously. Recent cases of possible exposures across the Public Safety bureaus serve as a constant reminder of the prevalence of the virus. A Pittsburgh Bureau of Police zone officer recently tested positive for COVID-19, resulting in a number of other officers and supervisors being placed in isolation or quarantine pending test results or medical clearance. As a result, Public Safety is taking additional precautions in an effort to prevent its personnel from the contracting the virus. Effective immediately, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich has suspended all in-person training programs and inter-unit rotations for Police, Fire, and EMS until after the election period. “Protecting Public Safety personnel is of paramount importance at all times, but even more so during this pandemic. That requires keeping our personnel healthy so there is a full complement of first responders ready and available to serve and protect Pittsburgh residents and visitors,” Director Hissrich said. Compliance with wearing masks and practicing social distancing will continue to be emphasized and enforced across all of the Public Safety bureaus. In addition, Pittsburgh Public Safety acknowledges that there is a heightened level of interest in how its personnel are preparing ahead of the federal election on Tuesday, November 3. We are working closely with Allegheny County and all of our local, state and federal partners to prepare for all contingencies. While the bureaus do not provide specific operational details, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will be moving to 12-hour shifts from November 2 until November 8. All pass days, personal days and holidays will be cancelled during that time. PITTSBURGH, PA (October 23, 2020) -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police held a promotions ceremony on Thursday inside Council Chambers. Officers Jeffrey Upson, William Friberger, Robert Monticelli, Kyle Nelson, and Peter Bechtold were promoted to the rank of sergeant. \"To you five...I couldn't be prouder. This is the most favorite part of my job. I couldn't ask for better people to accept leadership responsibility than you,\" said Police Chief Scott Schubert. Chief Schubert told the group they'd all proven themselves time and again on the job. \"You now have an opportunity to mentor officers in the field and model the things that you do currently in your assignments. Take that experience to help others learn and help keep them safe.\" Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich called the officers among the most diversified, well-trained, and experienced that the Bureau has promoted to sergeant. \"The decisions that you make and the leadership and guidance you provide to the officers will make a difference and potentially save lives,\" said Hissrich. Before Mayor William Peduto administered the Oath of Office, he told the soon-to-be sergeants, that their new rank is considered one of the most important positions within the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, as they help guide a younger and more diverse force. \"You'll be responsible for not only their training, but their day to day safety. You'll be responsible for when they put on that uniform, that they do it in a way that is respectful to not only every officer that has served in this bureau before, but every officer who will wear that uniform after you have retired,\" said Mayor Peduto. The five new sergeants will be assigned to three of the six police zones. Congratulations Sergeants Upson, Friberger, Monticelli, Nelson, and Bechtold!

The Nuisance Bar Task Force will continue to address complaints forwarded by the public and conduct regular, unannounced checks at problem properties,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. If you have a complaint about an establishment in your neighborhood, you can call the Nuisance Bar Hotline at (412) 323-7777. PITTSBURGH, PA (November 10, 2020) -- Pittsburgh Public Safety and Pittsburgh Park Rangers would like to inform visitors to Frick Park that ' Posted - No Hunting' signs have recently been erected at several key points on the property. A jewel in the City, Frick Park receives hundreds of visitors to its more than 600 acres each day. At this time of year, while deer and other wildlife are highly visible, it is imperative that visitors be able to use the park safely. \"There are numerous children, bicyclists, pedestrians and pets within the parks and hunting of any kind could lead to tragic results. The Departments of Public Safety and Parks and Recreation will enforce the City ordinance in an effort to protect park visitors,\" said Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich. Interfering with wildlife in City parks is strictly prohibited. This includes hunting, trapping, feeding, and/or harvesting. Pittsburgh Park Rangers have jurisdiction over all Pittsburgh Parks and are actively present in all five regional parks including Emerald View, Frick, Highland, Riverview, and Schenley Parks. You can find the municipal code of ordinances here: https://library.municode.com/pa/pittsburgh/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=COOR_TITFOURPUPLPR_ARTXIPAPL_CH471JU Pittsburgh Public Safety continues to combat Covid-19, which is spreading rapidly across the county, commonwealth and country. As of this morning, nine Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officers, nine Pittsburgh Firefighters and three members of Pittsburgh EMS are currently positive for the virus. Multiple others have been placed in quarantine out of an abundance of caution in order to stop the spread, including about 100 Police officers. “The number fluctuates daily, but understand that those who are in quarantine are not positive. They are off as a precaution,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said Tuesday. “All but one of the (positive) employees are recuperating at home. One was hospitalized, but has been improving daily. Our thoughts are with everyone who has been affected.” Public Safety’s positive test rates remain significantly lower that what other major city First Responders are experiencing. The low infection rates have allowed Public Safety to proactively quarantine everyone who was possibly exposed, and to maintain normal staffing levels. “When you call 911, rest assured you’re going to get the assistance you need,” Hissrich said. “We’re going a step above what is required. Our numbers have been so low that we can take these precautions. … We have to be cautious and we have to make sure our First Responders have the equipment and the training they need to respond to every call.” Several preventative steps are in place across all Public Safety bureaus, and have been since March, including: Mandatory masks and social distancing, daily screenings upon entry to any Public Safety facility, and strict quarantine/isolation procedures. EMS, Fire and Police officials meet daily via Teams Meetings with Director Hissrich and the City of Pittsburgh’s Medical Director, Dr. Ronald Roth, to discuss the pandemic. EMS has reactivated a second specialized EMS unit with enhanced decontamination capabilities and advanced PPE to respond to suspected Covid cases. “We’re taking all the precautions we can,” Hissrich said. “We’ve learned a lot over the last few months (and) we’re taking this very seriously PITTSBURGH, PA (Dec. 30, 2020) — As with nearly everything in this challenging and tumultuous year, Pittsburgh’s New Year’s Eve celebrations will be different from years past. Dec. 31 is traditionally a night that draws tens of thousands of people to the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s Highmark First Night Pittsburgh celebrations at venues throughout Downtown. Not this year. Due to the pandemic, venues are closed, large gatherings are prohibited, fireworks have been cancelled and First Night has transformed into a made-for-TV-only event. “I know that we all want—and absolutely deserve—to celebrate New Year’s Eve as we always do: With family and friends, with fireworks and with fanfare,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “That’s just not possible or responsible this year. Better times are certainly ahead, but we must maintain our resolve now in order to see this pandemic through to the end.” Hissrich re-issued his traditional New Year’s Eve message, with a caveat: Celebrate responsibly—ideally at home—and do not engage in dangerous or illegal activities. Such activities include shooting guns off in the air. What goes up will come down, and the results are tragic when people are hit by celebratory gunfire. Just last year, a woman in Texas was struck and killed by a descending bullet as she stood in her driveway to watch fireworks. There have been many other documented cases of celebratory gunfire killing innocent people. Police will monitor and respond to ShotSpotter activations throughout the city. Officers will arrest anyone caught discharging a firearm in public. As a reminder, city law prohibits the use of any fireworks, even those that are legal, within 150 feet of a structure. Never drink and drive. Officers will be actively looking for impaired motorists. Lastly, please adhere to the Governor’s health regulations regarding Covid-19. Wear a mask, social distance and do not attend gatherings with people from outside of your home. Be safe, Pittsburghers, as we rightfully banish 2020 to the ash heap of history and turn a hopeful eye to what might lie ahead. PITTSBURGH, PA (January 4, 2021) - Last evening, Pittsburgh Police Zone 2 officers, the Fire Investigation Unit, and the Bomb Squad responded to two separate incidents involving explosives. The first incident that occurred in the 3600 block of Penn Avenue just after 9 p.m. involved an Improvised Explosive Device (IED).

Pittsburgh Police will be running checkpoints and roving patrols throughout Pittsburgh between the hours of 5 p.m. and 3 a.m. on February 7. These measures are in conjunction with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and PennDOT’s Impaired Driving Enforcement Campaign for Super Bowl weekend.

The City of Pittsburgh’s DUI Task Force is committed to reducing the number of DUI- related incidents to ensure safer roads for Pittsburgh residents and visitors all year round. PennDOT’s Western Alliance / Team DUI Program consists of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, the Pennsylvania State Police, and numerous local police departments that conduct sobriety checkpoints and roving DUI patrols across Western Pennsylvania. February 24, 2021 (PITTSBURGH, PA) -- On the morning of January 28 of this year, a series of unpredictable detours resulted in a mother and daughter from West Mifflin driving over the Homestead Grays Bridge and ultimately saving the life of a stranger. Tanikka Pinnix and Layla Gooden spotted a woman in distress, not wearing a coat, with one leg up on the bridge railing. They quickly pulled their vehicle over and managed to calmly convince the woman to come down to safety, all before emergency services personnel had arrived at the scene. Today in Council Chambers, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich, on behalf of Mayor William Peduto and City Council, proclaimed Wednesday, February 24, 2021 Tanikka Pinnix and Layla Gooden Day, recognizing them as outstanding citizens who undoubtedly prevented a tragedy through their kindness and empathy. Director Hissrich was on the bridge that day, along with Bureau of Emergency Medical Services Division Chief Richard Linn and District Chief Justin Sypolt, to witness the positive outcome, thanks to the selfless actions of Ms. Pinnix and Ms. Gooden. “I have responded to well over a dozen of these types of incidents and most don’t turn out well for the victim. It is comforting to know that by your work, that this one, this incident, even though it was a personal tragedy for the individual, that stranger that you saved continues to be able to live today and receive the help that she needs,” said Director Hissrich. EMS District Chief Sypolt honored the women and thanked them on behalf of the Public Safety and EMS Bureaus. “I know that on that day you probably didn’t wake up thinking that today’s the day I’m going to change the world, but due to a series of unpredictable events, change the world you did. Because of what you did that day, another person is walking amongst us. I am incredibly grateful to have been there with you both that day, and to be with you now.” Upon being honored, Ms. Pinnix shared her thoughts. “We should remember the greatest commandment of all, which is to love one another. And when I saw the woman on the bridge that day, I saw my own child. I felt every emotion as though that were my own flesh and blood.” Congratulations to Tanikka Pinnix and Layla Gooden for embodying the best of the City of Pittsburgh! March 2, 2021 (PITTSBURGH, PA) -- In 2020, the City of Pittsburgh began witnessing large numbers of unlawful, off-road vehicles such as ATV’s and dirt bikes riding recklessly on city streets, taking over roadways and intersections, driving on sidewalks and, in many cases, even driving the wrong direction. Major cities across the country have also been experiencing the same issues associated with these illegal vehicles, sometimes with deadly consequences. Last September in New York City, an ATV rider was struck and killed by an SUV when he drove into a crosswalk against a red light. Two years ago another rider lost an eye during a collision. In Pittsburgh last summer, a dirt bike rider driving in a bicycle lane on Liberty Avenue was injured when he clipped a turning vehicle and was thrown from his dirt bike onto the back of a parked car. Participants in these so–called “flash mobs” or “ride-outs” are now taking their actions to alarming new heights in the City of Pittsburgh, with as many as 50 to 200 riders roving through neighborhoods at any given time, disobeying traffic rules. Just this past week in the City, police issued eight citations and towed two vehicles from a ride-out event. One of those citations stemmed from a traffic stop where a dirt-bike rider was driving the wrong way toward police on N. Beatty Street. These all-terrain vehicles are not designed to be driven on public roads and they pose a serious danger to the general public, law enforcement, and to the illegal riders themselves. “It is just a matter of time before this irresponsible behavior leads to a serious injury or death either of the rider, or to an innocent pedestrian or motorist in Pittsburgh,” said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich. As a result, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, in collaboration with its regional law enforcement partners, has devised a comprehensive operational plan to address this issue. The three-pronged response will focus on the following: As part of the investigative process, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and its law enforcement partners will utilize any available technology to stop these unauthorized vehicles from driving on city streets. “Police want people to enjoy their ATV’s and dirt bikes, but to do so in a legal and safe way. We cannot address this problem alone and we are asking for the public’s help to put an end to these dangerous and disruptive ride-outs in the City,” said Pittsburgh Police Commander Eric Holmes. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police has created an email address for the public to provide information and tips to Police. Emails can be sent to: 412_TIPS@pittsburghpa.gov. As always, please dial 9-1-1 in an emergency. PITTSBURGH, PA (March 4, 2021—The City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Public Safety held swearing-in and promotions ceremonies for the Pittsburgh Bureau of Emergency Medical Services and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Thursday afternoon at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich administered the oaths at both ceremonies. “I congratulate you and I wish you the best of luck,” Hissrich said. “I’d also like to thank the families for their continued support. You know what (First responders) go through day to day, and you’re always there for them.” For EMS, Matthew Guerriero and Daniel Kerns were sworn in as Emergency Medical Technicians, Samson Adams and Michael Gualdoni were sworn in as Paramedics, and Roxanne Elk was promoted to Paramedic. “I want to welcome all the family and friends of the paramedics and EMTs being sworn in today,” EMS Chief Ron Romano said. “I thank you for sharing them with us and for understanding when they miss a family event because they were helping someone else.” For Fire, Christopher Aiello, James Harkins, Joseph Kuntz and Richard Shay were promoted to the rank of Captain. Ralph Browning, Kari Burnham, Frank Caputo, Mark Godlewski, Garrett Meade, Matthew Novotny, Keith Ott, Adam Robinson, Guy Scatena, Patrick Stack, Philip Thompson, D’lon Walker and Richard Willett were promoted to the rank of Lieutenant. “Today we are recognizing people who put in a lot of time and effort to become officers in what I deem to be the best fire department in the world,” Fire Chief Darryl Jones said. “I know how well you are trained, I know how well you’re prepared to handle this, and I have the utmost faith that you can do the job.” Lt. Kari Burnham, one of five women in the Bureau, is now the highest-ranking female in the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire, and the first woman promoted to Lt. since 1995. Such ceremonies typically occur in Council Chambers at the City-County Building. They were moved to the Convention Center to accommodate Covid-19 safety measures. PITTSBURGH, PA (March 5, 2021)—The Office of Mayor William Peduto, Pittsburgh Public Safety and the Office of Community Health and Safety announce the creation of the Opioid Overdose Dashboard, a public tool that will help form and guide policies and programs to more effectively address unsafe opioid use in the City of Pittsburgh. The dashboard compiles Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS data to map monthly opioid overdose calls and Public Safety’s response. Data will include the number of people who overdose, neighborhood-level mapping, demographic information, and other statistics regarding care provided by on-scene First Responders. \"While this is a data-driven initiative, it's really about using all the resources at the City's disposal into giving our residents a helping hand. That means cross-department coordination, best practices in care and support, and now a Dashboard to help guide our work as effectively as possible,\" Mayor William Peduto said. First Responders, to include Pittsburgh EMS, Fire and Police, respond to drug overdoses and have saved many lives through their training and the use of Narcan and CPR, Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “And they will continue to save lives,” Hissrich said. “But to more effectively address the root of the problem, everyone must join together. Having more data will lead to a better understanding of the issues and, hopefully, actionable solutions.” In addition to the public dashboard, the Office of Community Health and Safety will issue weekly reports to City staff and partner organizations, including healthcare, public health, and harm reduction organizations, with the goal of coordinating an equitable public health-informed response to the overdose crisis. This data will also provide the Office of Community Health and Safety and its partners with a more complete picture of the impacted neighborhoods, allowing for direct engagement with community leaders who best understand the needs of their neighbors. “In response to the worsening crisis, the Office of Community Health and Safety is committed to utilizing insights gained from improved data analysis to inform progressive opioid overdose prevention strategies that seek to reduce harm associated with drug use, employ a person-first approach, and address social determinants of health,” said Laura Drogowski, Office of Community Health and Safety Manager. Within the Office of Community Health and Safety, this work will be led by the Overdose Prevention Program Coordinator in partnership with Pittsburgh EMS and the Allegheny County Health Department’s CDC-funded Overdose Data to Action program, which aims to strengthen local capacity to address overdoses across the county. The City of Pittsburgh is among stakeholders partnering with ACHD through this county-wide program to monitor emerging trends to inform prevention activities that reduce harms associated with substance use. Mayor Peduto created The Office of Community Health and Safety in June with the goal of redirecting city resources to better meet community needs by housing social services, public health and social work experts who can assist first responders in situations that require longer-term assistance, harm reduction support and other services. For more information on the office, click here. PITTSBURGH, PA (March 12, 2021) — For a second consecutive year, St. Patrick’s Day celebrations in Pittsburgh will be decidedly different and muted because of ongoing Covid-19 safety measures. Health officials continue to encourage pandemic protocols restricting large crowds and encouraging mask-wearing, social distancing and hand-washing. Bar and restaurant occupancy restrictions will reduce crowd sizes at traditional holiday gathering spots, including the Southside, North Shore and Downtown. The annual St. Patrick’s Day parade has been moved to the fall. While many people are understandably weary of pandemic restrictions, Pittsburgh Public Safety urges continued vigilance, and promises a continued focus on keeping everyone safe and catching law-breakers. “Now is not the time to let down our guard,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “Covid-19 has forced us down a long and unwanted path, but this journey will near its end if—and only if—we maintain our discipline in fighting this virus.” As always, Director Hissrich announced a zero-tolerance policy for disruptive and illegal behavior, to include underage drinking, public intoxication and drinking and driving. Pittsburgh Police and partner law enforcement agencies will monitor crowds for any illegal activity, and DUI Patrols will actively seek anyone who drives under the influence. Open container laws will be strictly enforced. While the state has allowed restaurants to sell cocktails-to-go during the pandemic, it is illegal for such beverages to be consumed in public spaces. Please note that anyone caught with an open container will be cited. Pittsburgh Fire officials will conduct occupancy checks, and will clear and close any establishment that exceeds occupancy limits. Law enforcement will also cite and arrest anyone caught illegally driving off-road vehicles on city streets. We ask the public to send tips on such illegal rides to 412_TIPS@pittsburghpa.gov. Police will monitor City Security Cameras for illegal activity. Officers on horseback, bicycles, motorcycles and foot patrols will also be utilized. Lastly, Public Safety encourages anyone who chooses to go out to wear a mask, wash your hands and maintain social distancing. With more people getting vaccinated and practicing common sense precautions, life will return to normal. The time to celebrate publicly will come. But in the continued age of Covid-19, Public Safety urges everyone to celebrate at home, avoid large crowds and—if you do go out—act responsibly. PITTSBURGH, PA (March 19, 2021)—The latest Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire recruit class was sworn in during a ceremony Friday morning at the Fire Academy on Washington Boulevard. “Today, after 32-plus weeks, you have patches on your sleeve; you represent the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire,” Fire Chief Darryl Jones said. “A lot of pride comes with that. I appreciate that because I am also very proud to have the patches on my sleeve. “But there’s more than just pride. There’s responsibility. And there is privilege. You have the privilege to serve the people of Pittsburgh—our residents, our visitors, our guests. That is a privilege.” Mayor William Peduto administered the oath to the 23 recruit graduates, who started their journey at the academy in April. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich applauded the recruits' hard work, but also took time to acknowledge their families for the sacrifices they have and will make. “To the families, thank you very much for loaning us your loved ones,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said. “They will have good days, they will have bad days. They will need your support. So in advance, thank you.” The class started and finished during a pandemic, which required patience and adjustments to how skills were taught. For example, a typical class has 32 recruits, but this one started with 24 and graduated 23. The smaller class was needed in order to comply with the Governor’s Covid-19 measures banning gatherings larger than 25 people. Still, they endured. And on Monday, they will begin their careers as Pittsburgh Firefighters. “It’s not a career that many people would be willing to do knowing the possibility of having to be in a situation where you’re valuing somebody else more than yourself—you’re willing to put yourself at risk in order to help someone else,” Mayor Peduto said. “It’s a job unlike other jobs. It’s a calling.” The graduation ceremony and a skills demonstration were livestreamed and can be found on the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire and Pittsburgh Public Safety Facebook pages. PITTSBURGH, PA (March 22, 2021) -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police held a promotions ceremony on Monday inside the Mayor’s Conference Room at the City County Building. Detective James Sherer and Detective Joseph Simunovic were promoted to the rank of Sergeant. “You are the ones out there day in, day out with the troops helping them be the best they can be,” said Police Chief Scott Schubert. “I have no doubt that you will be extremely successful in helping our officers.” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich reminded the new sergeants of their increased responsibility and thanked them for their dedicated service. “The direction you provide your officers in the first five to ten minutes will very likely save lives,” said Hissrich. “Thank you for choosing Pittsburgh for your career, and thank you for staying here.\" Mayor William Peduto addressed the officers before administering the Oath of Office. “When you put these stripes on your arms, they are more than just a promotion, they are a reflection of the young officers who are going to continue to be a part of this Bureau,” Mayor Peduto said. “The examples you set are going to be the ones the younger officers follow.\" Congratulations to the new Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Sergeants Sherer and Simunovic! PITTSBURGH, PA (March 25, 2021)—Often overlooked in the criminal process are the victims, people whose lives are instantly altered through no choice of their own. The City of Pittsburgh’s Public Safety Department strives to help victims of crime through The Office of Victim Assistance Services, which connects victims to any type of service they might need, including crisis intervention, referrals, information and advocacy. “As a victim of crime, you’ve just experienced trauma, an unexpected trauma,” said Victim Services Coordinator Alexandra Abboud. “At the flip of a switch, your whole life has changed—the way you see the world, the way you interact with the world, the way you lived your day to life has changed. And (victims) don’t know where to go and they don’t what to do. They need guidance to get them through this and to say, okay, what is our next step?” Abboud checks crime reports daily to identify victims of crime, contact them and offer support. Any other victims seeking resources can now find it on the City’s newly-launched Victim Assistance website, which provides contacts to the Office and numerous other city and regional resources. “Victims of crime experience trauma from the incident itself and trauma from the barriers encountered when accessing systems that were created to provide support and resources,” said Shatara Murphy, Public Safety Assistant Director, Community Affairs. “The Victim Assistance Office is the support that families need, helping to eliminate some of those barriers and connect them to service providers and support. This isn’t just a warm hand off. The office is dedicated to the victim and their family and will be by their side throughout the process. When Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich created this office and asked me to manage it, we were clear that we didn’t just want to be another resource. We will serve as a partner to the community and we are committed to that partnership.” Mayor William Peduto said the effort is part of the City’s goal of helping all residents. \"Public Safety provides many services but at the department's heart is one main goal, and that is to be there for people in need of help. Having a coordinator in place whose sole job is providing assistance to victims is a major part of the City's efforts to give help to all, and especially those who are most vulnerable,” Mayor Peduto said. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said he is proud of the work of the Victims Assistance Office, as it speaks to the City- and Department-wide desire to put others first. “Public Safety is a dynamic department that doesn’t only include First Responders who save lives daily in times of urgency and emergency,” Hissrich said. “It also includes compassionate people who methodically consider the long-term needs of those who need help, and then take steps to provide it.” Abboud, who started in her position on Aug. 3, 2020, said her goal is to help victims throughout the process, which often means multiple follow-up contacts. “They need somebody to talk to, somebody to listen to them and say, ‘I’m here for you. I got you, I’m on your side. What are your needs? We’ll get through this together,” she said. For more information on the Office of Victim Assistance Services, please see this post on the Public Safety Facebook Page. TEST In response to recent incidents of concern in the City regarding animals and wildlife, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is announcing a new resource for the public to address animal welfare complaints and concerns. The Bureau has created a central email address where citizens and officers can send information or ask questions of its Animal Law Team. The email address is: Animal.Law@pittsburghpa.gov. The messages will go directly to Animal Law Team members within the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. “We want to ensure that no concerns regarding the welfare and safety of the City’s animal population go unaddressed,” says Pittsburgh Police Lieutenant, Julie Stoops. From Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich, \"Protecting pets and wildlife in our city is everyone's responsibility and reflects on who we are as Pittsburghers. Pittsburgh Police want to make it easy for citizens to give a voice to the voiceless by reporting any issues of concern about their welfare and safety so they can be addressed.\" As always, all emergencies should be immediately reported to 9-1-1.

PITTSBURGH, PA (April 19, 2021) -- The recent surge in violent crime in the City of Pittsburgh is causing concern and even fear among some residents. Pittsburgh Police share that concern, especially as many of the victims of these crimes have been young people. So far this year, there have been 20 homicides in the City and close to 50 non-fatal shootings, marking 80% and 90% increases respectively from the same time last year. Pittsburgh is not alone in dealing with this, as the escalation of violent crime is currently a national phenomenon. \"Although this uptick in violence appears to be a trend across the country, this is not our city. This is not Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will not allow this senseless loss of life to continue. Our officers will work directly with the community to get to the root cause of these crimes and stop them from occurring,\" Police Chief Scott Schubert said. Police have been taking a proactive approach to address the violence in the most affected neighborhoods. Community Resource Officers (CROs) and Neighborhood Resource Officers (NROs) from the Community Engagement Office have been walking through several communities each week, speaking with residents and business owners, listening to concerns and sharing ideas about ways to make their communities safer. Group Violence Intervention (GVI) outreach workers have also stepped up their presence. GVI is a partnership between law enforcement, outreach, social services and the faith community who mediate and interrupt violence. \"Public Safety will ensure police have the investigative tools, technology, and resources they need at this time. But, more importantly, we encourage members of the public to come forward and share their ideas, concerns, and information with police. Police can only solve crimes when everyone works together. That cooperation and collaboration is key,\" says Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich. Anyone with information about these violent crimes is asked to call Pittsburgh Police at (412) 323-7800. PITTSBURGH, PA (April 20, 2021) -- Pittsburgh, and indeed the whole world, closely watched the trial of former Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin in wake of the in-custody death of George Floyd on May 25, 2020. Today, a jury found Mr.Chauvin guilty of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. \"As police officers, we have a fundamental duty to care for and safeguard everyone and anyone in our custody. That did not occur. A man was deprived of his life, a family was deprived of their loved one, a community was deprived of their faith in the people who are entrusted to keep them safe,\" said Police Chief Scott Schubert. George Floyd's death sparked some of the largest civil rights protests in decades and shone a spotlight on police accountability and reform. \"The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police recognizes that our legitimacy is highly dependent on the mutual trust and respect we have with the communities we serve. Law enforcement is always evolving and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police remains steadfast in its commitment to working hand in hand with the public to implement professional law enforcement services that are fair, equitable, transparent and procedurally just to all members of the community,\" said Schubert. PITTSBURGH, PA (April 27, 2021) -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police has released its 2020 Annual Report. \"As we know, 2020 was a challenging year on many levels, for our country, for our communities, and for law enforcement. Between the global pandemic, civil unrest, calls for social justice reform and a tumultuous presidential election, it made for one of the most challenging years I've experienced in my 27 years as a member of the PBP. But every challenge provides an opportunity. I believe we have an opportunity now to reevaluate and reconfigure how we think and operate as an organization and profession. We embrace this opportunity,\" said Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert. The report includes statistics compiled by the Crime Analysis Unit on everything from the distribution of personnel based on rank, gender, and race, to information on arrests and citations, to crime statistics by neighborhood. Chief Schubert also acknowledged the Bureau’s ongoing commitment to establishing strong ties with each and every community in the City, even walking a beat in all of Pittsburgh's 90 neighborhoods and encouraging his officers to do the same. Officers with the Community Engagement Office, under the direction of Chief Schubert, are now literally following in his footsteps with weekly walks in different communities. \"I am a firm believer in relational policing and the positive impact it has on our personnel and the community. We recognize that our legitimacy largely depends on a mutual trust and respect between police and the communities we serve. For that reason and others, the PBP will continue to implement relational policing into everything we do,\" said Schubert. Most importantly the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police remains more committed than ever to providing transparency, building relationships and defining and scaling success within the Bureau based on the doctrine of 21st Century Policing. “Behind the numbers in this report are the hundreds of dedicated men and women who make up the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. Their willingness to adapt and grow as a police force, build relationships in the community, make personal sacrifices, and their commitment to keeping Pittsburgh safe, make me proud of the work they do each and every day,” said Schubert.

PITTSBURGH, PA, (June 2, 2021) – The COVID-19 pandemic impacted lives and changed the way cities operate around the world in 2020. Many of Pittsburgh’s traditional and beloved events were either cancelled or postponed until 2021 and some of those planned activities continue to be disrupted. Now, with several mitigation restrictions being eased across Allegheny County and the Commonwealth, Pittsburgh Public Safety, the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI), and the Department of Public Works (DPW), would like to remind residents of the City’s permit requirements for large and small events, temporary outdoor dining spaces, and park shelter rentals. Block Party Permits: Designed to allow neighbors the ability to close their street and celebrate their block, these permits cost $25 and are available through a simple online application. - Block Party permits are limited to residentially zoned streets and applicants must live on the block being closed. These permits are for weekends or holidays from 10am to 10pm. - The City’s open container law and certain noise ordinance laws are waived for block parties allowing citizens to gather and celebrate with their neighbors. Applications for Block Party Permits must be submitted at least seven (7) business days before the event. Special Event Permits: These permits are for outdoor community and civic events that take place on public property. Whether it’s a charity walk, competitive 5K, street festival, or concert in a park, these permits allow for larger outdoor public gatherings to take place on City property. - Special Event permits are available via an online application. Permit applications must be submitted at least 14 business days in advance of the event date. - Permits are $200 plus the cost of any contracted City services. For more information or to apply for Block Party Permits and Special Event permits, please visit www.pittsburghpa.gov/events/eventapp During the pandemic, Pittsburgh businesses and restaurants became more innovative than ever and the popularity of some new traditions is expected to continue into the summer. Temporary Outdoor Dining & Retail Program: This program allows Pittsburgh restaurants and other businesses to easily apply for temporary sidewalk cafe, parking lane cafe, full street closure, and curbside pick-up zone permits. This helps businesses and restaurants provide outdoor space and promote social distancing while Pittsburgh slowly reopens and while businesses recover from the pandemic. As part of the program, businesses can apply for one or more of the following temporary permits: - Sidewalk Cafe Permit to utilize existing sidewalk space in front of a business for retail or dining. - Parking Lane Cafe Permit to utilize the parking lane in front of a business for retail or dining. - Full Street Closure Permit to significantly change part of a street or a full street for outdoor walking, shopping, and dining. These permits are free through the end of 2021. Obtaining a permit and working with City staff to create a site plan is important to ensure your outdoor cafe is safe for customers and the public space remains safe and accessible for all, including those who use wheelchairs, people with vision impairments, cyclists, and those pushing strollers. Visit https://pittsburghpa.gov/domi/outdoor-dining for more information. Park shelter and grove rentals: Park shelters and picnic groves are available to the public for rent through October 10, 2021. Park shelters are available for private events such as family picnics and reunions, graduation parties, and birthday parties. Shelters and groves should be booked online at https://registerparks.pittsburghpa.gov and can be rented one-year in advance. Requests for shelters made over the phone may take up to one week to process. PITTSBURGH, PA (June 8, 2021) -- The City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety has released a Request for Proposals (RFP) for an administrator for its STOP the Violence Community Investment Grant Program. The program will ultimately fund community projects intended to reduce violence in the City. The administrator will assure that an orderly, efficient, and transparent selection process is conducted to select those projects most responsive to community needs. The process of publicizing the opportunity, reviewing and selecting the fund recipients, and tracking results will be coordinated by the administrator under the direction of the Department of Public Safety. “In order to receive the desired outcomes to reduce violence in this city, we have to invest in initiatives that advance quality of life. This grant program is just one of the many ways that the Department of Public Safety will contribute to making that happen, said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich. Public Safety Assistant Director of Community Affairs, Shatara Murphy, will lead the project. “I’ve said this before; government does not have all the answers. We are fortunate to work with some amazing people who are truly concerned about the violence occurring across the city and want to do something about it, but they need access to resources to execute their ideas. I want to ensure that we are supportive and providing solutions, not creating barriers to resources. The selection of an administrator for this program will be vital to its success.” An initial investment of $1,000,000 will be made to support the program. The funds will come from the STOP the Violence Trust Fund, which was created by Mayor Peduto and City Council in 2020. The initiative was spearheaded by city councilmen Daniel Lavelle and Reverend Ricky Burgess. “This RFP is a critical step in ultimately providing social services needed to reduce violence in our city. It is part of our attempt to reimagine Public Safety,” said Reverend Burgess. “This is just a start. We have a lot more to do, but I am committed to finding ways to provide resources to community organizations that want to interrupt the epidemic of violence plaguing our communities,” said Councilman Lavelle. In addition to Assistant Director Murphy, Jay Gilmer, Coordinator of the City’s STOP the Violence Office, will provide support for this project. “Ultimately, this fund has the potential to stimulate systemic change and assist community members in addressing the unique challenges they determine to be the forces driving violence, said Gilmer.” \"Initiatives like this are just what we need to reimagine policing in Pittsburgh, and to do what residents expect from their city — to keep them, their families and their neighborhoods safe,\" Mayor William Peduto said. Potential applicants can view the opportunity here and search \"STOP the Violence\" in the search bar: https://pittsburghpa.gov/beacon/bid-opportunities.html PITTSBURGH, PA, (June 10, 2021) – June is National Safety Month and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire is pleased to announce an exciting new partnership with Duquesne Light Company (DLC) to provide our Hazardous Materials Response Team (HazMat) with an innovative training tool to learn safe containment of chemical and fuel spills from highway tank trailers. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire replicates hazardous materials spills for HazMat technicians with a highway trailer training prop at its facility on Washington Boulevard. Now, a critical assist from Duquesne Light's hydraulic service truck and mechanics, will help provide a “real-life” experience for first responders who encounter a tanker rollover emergency. “We are now able to position this prop to simulate a rollover of a tank or fuel trailer in transit. If a transportation emergency occurs, we can arrive and it’s in a variety of different configurations or positions. This one-of-a-kind training prop gives our team the opportunity to practice on a real-life, hands-on tool,” said Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Assistant Chief Brian Kokkila. “Duquesne Light is uniquely positioned with the equipment and expertise in hydraulic systems. We were able to ask for their help to power the hydraulic system and they really stepped up and helped us solve some challenges.” The simulator is set up with multiple different leak spots to ensure the HazMat team is presented with the most authentic scenarios to better prepare them for emergencies in the field. “When the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire approached us about this partnership, we jumped at the opportunity. We were honored that they came to us knowing we have the right skills and equipment to do the job safely and effectively. With the help of our mechanics and hydraulic service truck, we were able to successfully complete the rollover and enable the firefighters to begin their critical training. We’re grateful for the chance to support this effort and the positive impact it will have on the community, said Chuck O’Neill, DLC's Transportation Manager.\" The HazMat team responds to emergencies involving the release or potential release of hazardous material. It is a National Incident Management System (NIMS) Type 2 - Hazardous Materials Response Team certified by the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency. “Safety is always the top priority at DLC. With June being National Safety Month, it’s an ideal time to recognize our longstanding relationship with the City of Pittsburgh and our efforts to keep our customers and the public safe. We look forward to growing this partnership in the future and reinforcing our commitment to maintaining a safe community,\" said Kevin Walker, Chief Operating Officer, DLC. The City of Pittsburgh Hazardous Materials Response Team was established in 1986 as a joint effort between the Bureau of Fire and the Bureau of EMS. The team is comprised of Firefighters, Paramedics and Police Officers.

This is a planned exercise and is not in response to any current world events. During this period, the public may see or hear low-flying aircraft over parts of Southwestern Pennsylvania, which is routine for this type of training. However, the exercise is expected to have minimal impact to the public. To maintain the highest level of safety, there are no public viewing or media opportunities. Please contact the Pittsburgh Public Safety Public Information Office at PIO@pittsburghpa.gov if you have any questions. PITTSBURGH, PA, (June 14, 2021) -- Community and Neighborhood Resource officers with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Community Engagement Office (CEO) continue fanning out across the City each week. Officers meet with community members, hear concerns and ideas on how to minimize crime and violence, and form vital relationships with children and youth. Unfortunately many of the planned walks and events were postponed due to more inclement weather than usual, but officers met with as many community members as possible during the week of June 7 to June 13. The weekly Chess with Cops meet-ups in Market Square are still going strong. In fact, the event's popularity has even reached out-of-state chess aficionados. This past Tuesday, the Seguin family traveled from Charlotte, NC, not only to visit relatives in Shadyside, but also so their daughter Sydney, age 7 and son Baxter, age 5, could play chess with officers. Turns out, much to Officer Washington's surprise, that Baxter is a bit of a prodigy. Wednesday was a ribbon-cutting ceremony Officer Shifren attended to open a new dek hockey rink in Lincoln Place. Generous support from the Pittsburgh Penguins helped make the rink a reality. Also on Wednesday, CEO officers participated in a Stop the Violence prayer vigil at Lighthouse Cathedral with Reverend Porter. This event was hosted by South Pittsburgh Coalition for Peace. And finally, thanks to a collaboration between Community Engagement officers and members of the Mount Washington Community Development Corporation, some big improvements are planned for the Shiloh Parklet on Shiloh Street. The Community Engagement Office welcomes all suggestions and opportunities to meet with its officers. Please email Sergeant Tiffany Kline-Costa for more information: tiffany.kline-costa@pittsburghpa.gov PITTSBURGH, PA. (June 16, 2021) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire held a ceremony this morning for firefighters who were lost in the line of duty. The Pittsburgh Veteran Firefighter’s Association dedicated a plaque for line of duty deaths. The first line of duty death was in 1871. “It is important this plaque be placed here,” said IAFF Local 1 President Ralph Sicuro. “This is where we all started our careers as a Pittsburgh Firefighter.” “Today we honor the 134 men and women of Pittsburgh Fire who answered the ultimate call,” added Fire Chief Darryl Jones. “We celebrate their lives, and their memories.” “We do not gather here to mourn them, they have been mourned,” said Veteran Firefighter’s Association member John Gombita. “We come here to honor them, their character, bravery and their sacrifice.” The plaque will hang in the Pittsburgh Fire Academy Training Center for current and recruit firefighters to observe. PITTSBURGH, PA, (June 18, 2021) -- It was another jam-packed week for Pittsburgh Police Community Engagement Office (CEO) officers who visited several communities throughout the City. Zone 3 Officers Aundre Wright and Christine Luffey walked in Carrick on Monday, stopping on Kirk Avenue, near the location of a recent tragedy. A grateful resident shared photos of the officers with her grandson, a new American citizen recently arrived from Mexico. He had never seen a police car up close and Officers Wright and Luffey were more than happy to show him. On Tuesday, there was the recurring Chess with Cops event in Market Square and on Wednesday, Chess with Cops came to Allegheny Commons. Now that school is out for the summer, chess clubs are filled with children and youth who take turns playing with the Community Engagement officers. Zone 4 Officers Victoria Butch and Michael Rosato walked through East Liberty on Wednesday, stopping in to Home Depot with Pittsburgh Police comfort dog, Zane, so he could visit with the employees. Officers walked in Arlington on Thursday and were joined by members of the Arlington Civic Council. Zone 2 Acting Commander Matt Lackner and CEO Sergeant Tiffany Kline-Costa attended a Zone 2 Public Safety Council meeting in the evening, sharing with Hill community leaders and business owners about crime statistics and community engagement efforts in the area. They also fielded questions regarding mere encounters versus investigatory stops. There is a planned walk today, Friday, in Highland Park, and Officer David Shifren and Officer Michael Rosato will be bringing their chess boards to some of the Juneteenth celebration locations this weekend for those who would like to play. The Community Engagement Office welcomes all suggestions and opportunities to meet with its officers. Please email CEO Sergeant Tiffany Kline-Costa for more information: tiffany.kline-costa@pittsburghpa.gov PITTSBURGH, PA, (June 20, 2021) -- The Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris, will be visiting the City of Pittsburgh on Monday, June 21, 2021. In preparation for the Vice Presidential visit, Public Safety would like to inform residents that certain streets will be closed completely, while others will experience rolling closures as the motorcade moves around the City. Motorists should expect delays and detours in some areas. E. Carson Street between S.28th Street and Sarah Street will be shut down from approximately 12 p.m. until 4:30 p.m. \"The public should pack a measure of patience, have an alternative route or routes in mind, and expect traffic delays as the Vice President's motorcade travels through the City on Monday,\" said Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Commander, Eric Holmes. Public Safety will inform residents via social media when the motorcade has passed and the streets have reopened. PITTSBURGH, PA (June 21, 2021) -- Members from the Pittsburgh Bureau of Emergency Medical Services (EMS), Citiparks, and the Office of Community Health and Safety will be distributing youth-sized personal flotation devices (life vests) and safe swimming information packets to youth and parents at three of the City’s summer lunch grab-and-go locations on Wednesday, June 23. The Safe Swim initiative, led by EMS, aims to increase swimming and water safety throughout the City of Pittsburgh. The initiative began last summer in response to the widespread closures of community pools due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which increased the possibility of children and youth swimming in less-supervised settings, such as backyard pools or open water. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, after motor vehicle crashes, drowning is the second leading cause of unintentional injury death among children ages 1-14. There is an additional racial disparity, as Black children ages 10-14 years drown at rates 7.6 times higher than other children. Thanks to a donation of youth-sized personal flotation devices from Allegheny Health Network and Highmark, the initiative will provide the free life vests and educational materials to encourage children and parents to adopt safe swimming practices this summer. The life vests will be available at the Mellon, Beechview, and Troy Hill spray parks from 9:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. and will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. PITTSBURGH, PA (June 22, 2021) – It’s no secret that Pittsburghers love their fireworks. From Pirates games to Independence Day at Point State Park, elaborate fireworks displays are a time worn tradition in the City. Consumer-grade fireworks became legal to purchase in Pennsylvania in October 2017, resulting in a sharp annual increase in fireworks-related calls for service in the City of Pittsburgh. Last year, private use of fireworks in Pittsburgh resulted in seven structure fires, several brush fires, reported injuries, and multiple noise complaints. The Fireworks Task force handed out 22 citations. Beginning tonight, June 22, the Fireworks Task Force (FTF) will be out in all zones beginning at 7 p.m. until 2 a.m. every night until July 5. Although fireworks may now be legal to purchase, it is not legal to discharge them within 150 feet of a structure. They are also not permitted for use in any City park, ball field, or any City-owned property. When Fireworks Task Force members and uniformed police officers respond to initial fireworks-related complaints they will explain the laws and regulations governing consumer fireworks in the City. Subsequent calls to the same address could result in a $100 citation and confiscation of the fireworks. “The use of fireworks in the City can result in serious injuries and destruction of properties, as well as being very disruptive and unnerving for both people and pets,” said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich. “That’s why this year, in a concerted effort to keep everyone safe, we will also be utilizing the City’s Shotspotter system to help track illegal fireworks use.” The Fireworks Task Force is comprised of eight members from the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire. PITTSBURGH, PA (June 22, 2021) -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will be conducting another blitz on abandoned vehicles in the City. On Wednesday, June 23, motorcycle units and abandoned vehicle officers from multiple police zones will focus on citizen complaints regarding abandoned vehicles in the Homewood neighborhood beginning at 10 a.m. The first blitz at the end of April focused on the Allentown, Beltzhoover, Carrick, Arlington Heights and Knoxville neighborhoods. Police investigated 124 complaints and towed 17 vehicles. Police will repeat the blitzes throughout the city in the coming weeks and months to clear as many 311 complaints as possible. Residents may report abandoned vehicles to the 311 Response Center by calling 311, 412-255-2621, or by filing an online 311 Request Form. (PITTSBURGH, PA) -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police today addressed the marked escalation in the number of homicides and non-fatal shooting incidents in the City of Pittsburgh this year. Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich, members of Police command staff, Gun Violence Intervention (GVI), representatives from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), Community Outreach members, and families of gun violence victims gathered at the Center for Victims on E. Carson Street. Year-to-date there have been 31 homicides, compared with 20 homicides at the same time in 2020. There have been 76 non-fatal shootings since January. \"I'm tired of going out to scenes and seeing families and communities grieving,\" said Director Hissrich. \"It's going to be a long fight and it's going to be a a very hard summer for us, but I'm sure with the help of our communities and our partners, that we'll end what we're facing.\" Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert made an impassioned plea for the violence to stop, referencing recent cases of homicides and non-fatal shootings involving young people, including a teenager shot multiple times and killed just steps from his family home, and a six-year-old girl shot and wounded in a car. “There's so many guns on the street. No community, no zone in the City of Pittsburgh is immune. We're losing our loved ones to the senseless violence,\" said Chief Schubert. \"This stuff has got to stop. We're going to use every partner we have to make sure that happens and we're going to work as a team. But I implore you, we need the community to help us. We cannot do this alone. We have to do it together.\" Matthew Varisco, ATF Special Agent in Charge from the Philadelphia Field Division, provided a snapshot of the guns used in crimes in Pittsburgh. \"Of the firearms that were recovered and traced, the vast majority were pistols and they were recovered unfortunately from felons, \" said Varisco. He added that approximately 75% of those firearms were purchased in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and that Pittsburgh Police are on pace to recover as many as 800 firearms this year. The ATF is creating a firearms trafficking unit in Pittsburgh, assigning two of its agents to work with Pittsburgh Police to help stem the flow of illegal guns in the city and reduce gun violence. Assistant Chief of Police Lavonnie Bickerstaff pointed to some of the challenges the COVID-19 pandemic posed in trying to support and provide resources to young people and keep them from resolving disputes with firearms. \"During the pandemic, our violence prevention strategy, which has proven to be successful over the last four to five years, has been hampered to a degree because of our inability to have face-to- face contact with our young people. We were restricted from our custom notifications, we were restricted from hospital visits after shootings. We did not have the support and the mediation that we normally have from our coaches, from our teachers that help to calm down disputes before people pick up a gun and, of course, our recreation centers were closed,\" Bickerstaff said, adding that Police and Community Outreach workers had to retool their supportive efforts and find healthy ways to provide resources to the neighborhoods they serve. Valerie Dixon and Preeti Tuli, two mothers who lost their sons to gun violence twenty years apart, spoke about the lasting pain and the trauma caused by gun violence. Tuli's 18-year-old son Ahmir was murdered in February outside of her Strip District business. \"He was a good kid. He didn't deserve it. None of these kids do,\" said Tuli. \"We really need to come together. People need to start talking. There's tip lines. You can remain anonymous.\" Valerie Dixon's son Robert was shot and killed on Friday, June 25, 2001 in Lincoln-Lemington. \"Twenty years later that pain is still the same. Twenty years later my friends now are people who are interrupters. People who want to stop the violence, people who work with victims. I have a whole new set of friends who have helped me heal over the years because the pain never goes,\" said Dixon. Pittsburgh Police are increasing patrols in active areas and will continue focusing on deterrence measures in an effort to curb gun violence. Anyone with information about a violent crime is urged to call Pittsburgh Police at (412) 323-7800. PITTSBURGH, PA (June 25, 2021) -- Community Resource and Neighborhood Resource officers with the Pittsburgh Police Community Engagement Office (CEO) had a full week of events and activities. On Monday, officers, along with some members of police command staff, were invited to Allegheny General Hospital to receive a generous donation of about 200 bicycle helmets. CEO officers will have them on hand to give out to cyclists who need them. On Tuesday, the weekly Market Square Chess with Cops event was blessed with beautiful weather that attracted even more young players than usual. Officers also helped with a food distribution event at the Most Holy Name of Jesus parish in Troy Hill, and finished the day with a community walk through the Allentown neighborhood. Chess continued on Wednesday with the Queens Gambit meet up in Allegheny Commons. On Thursday, following a violent crime on Bedford Avenue that morning, Community Engagement officers did a group walk in the Hill District to speak with residents and listen to their concerns. Officers rounded out the week with a walk in East Carnegie on Friday morning where they met and spoke with some residents and the contractor giving them an estimate on a new roof! The Community Engagement Office welcomes all suggestions and opportunities to meet with its officers. Please email CEO Sergeant Tiffany Kline-Costa for more information: tiffany.kline-costa@pittsburghpa.gov PITTSBURGH, PA (July 1, 2021) --- After muted Independence Day celebrations in the City last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Pittsburgh is set to mark the Fourth of July with fanfare this coming weekend. The City-sponsored fireworks display is back with the City of Pittsburgh’s 2021 Independence Day Celebration in Point State Park on Sunday, July 4. The celebration and activities leading up to the main event are sure to draw large crowds to the Downtown core. In preparation, Pittsburgh Police are working with their local law enforcement partners, Community Engagement officers, and Community Outreach members in an effort to keep everyone safe this holiday. “We expect this to be one of the busiest nights of the year with people eager to celebrate after a challenging time. We are all looking forward to getting back to some semblance of normalcy, but Public Safety’s primary focus will always be to protect residents and visitors so they can safely enjoy Independence Day with their families and friends,” said Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich. \"Schubert quote??\" “To that end, there will be increased lighting in key locations Downtown. Pittsburgh Police and Allegheny County Mounted Units will be in place to ensure crowds keep moving so there are clear ingress and egress points for first responders to reach people should an emergency occur.” State Police will also be paying close attention to the Fort Pitt and Fort Duquesne bridges which are popular vantage points to watch the fireworks display. For everyone’s safety, police will ensure vehicle traffic keeps flowing on the bridge decks. Motorcycle medics with the Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS will be operating at various points Downtown to more easily reach and treat patients in crowded areas. Traditional medic units will also stage near key fireworks viewing points on Mount Washington, the North Side, and Downtown. One of the things they will be watching out for is heat-related ailments. Temperatures are forecast to be in the high 70’s with high humidity and a 40% chance of precipitation on Independence Day. Dr. Donald Yealy, Chief Medical Officer with UPMC, says the most important thing to remember is that everyone’s body is a heat generator and we have to learn how to dissipate, or get rid of heat. “Things that either increase the amount of heat we are making or decrease our ability to get rid of the heat will put us at risk for having a complication, whether that is heat exhaustion or heat stroke,” says Yealy. “We become dehydrated from not drinking enough fluids or drinking the wrong fluids… alcohol is the wrong fluid as it goes out quickly. Certain medications can make us prone to either dehydration or less responsive to heat stresses. Those are things that either make us lose fluids or impair our ability to respond to heat.” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich would like to remind people of another hot weather danger. “Forgetting children in the back of hot vehicles is more common than most people might imagine and the results can be tragic. Leaving a window open even a crack is not enough. Temperatures inside a vehicle can rise by 20 degrees within 10 minutes even with a window open, putting children at risk for heat stroke and even death. The same is true for pets. Please remember to look before you lock,” Hissrich said. Due to a dramatic surge in fireworks complaints last year, Public Safety formed a Fireworks Taskforce to patrol city neighborhoods and respond to complaints of those using fireworks illegally. The Fireworks Taskforce will continue its nightly enforcement efforts until July 5. \"Chief Jones quote???\" “The challenge about using even consumer-grade fireworks is that they are miniature explosives or flame-inducing events. So, you have the risk of not only the blast injury, but also of heat injuries and with the case of sparklers, the flecks that come from this. So people have to be careful because often fireworks are being used in a celebratory setting, which means there sometimes alcohol or other forms of impaired judgment. That just multiplies the risk. These things can kill you. They can hurt your fingers or extremities. They can hurt people nearby and even occasionally, there’s ocular injuries from the explosion or sediment out there. Every year we see someone with a serious injury due to mishandling of fireworks.” And finally, Dr. Yealy would like to remind people that the pandemic is not over. Even though the activities are primarily outdoors, the virus still poses a risk to those who are not inoculated with one of CDC-approved COVID-19 vaccines. “This will always involve a certain amount of congregation. That’s what people do during holidays. If you’re fully vaccinated, that’s not a concern. But if you’re not, please wear that mask. The COVID-19 virus is still here with us,” says Yealy.

On East Carson Street, the increased volume of people has resulted in nearly impassable sidewalks, pedestrians flowing into the road amid traffic, and parked vehicles blocking safety lanes. There have also been fistfights, pedestrians struck by vehicles, and incidents of gun violence. “While we are glad that Pittsburgh is returning to some semblance of normalcy since the height of the pandemic, the situation on the South Side has become dangerous and untenable,” said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich. “First responder vehicles must have access to East Carson in case of an emergency and overcrowded sidewalks pose hazards to pedestrians who then spill onto the streets and into vehicle traffic. Without changes, someone is going to get seriously hurt or killed.” In response, beginning Friday, July 2, 2021 and going forward, Pittsburgh Police will first be issuing warnings and then citations to those who obstruct public passageways. If violators fail to comply, there may be physical arrests. The citations could carry penalties of up to $300, plus court costs. Police motorcycle and bicycle units will also be in place to enforce parking. All vehicles in violation of the posted measures will be towed. Public Safety encourages everyone to celebrate safely on the South Side, and throughout the City of Pittsburgh, and we wish you a happy and safe Fourth of July holiday weekend.

The family-friendly celebration and activities leading up to the main event are sure to draw large crowds to the Downtown core. In preparation, Pittsburgh Police, Allegheny County Police, Pennsylvania State Police, Port Authority Police, Pittsburgh Police Community Engagement Officers, and the Street Outreach team will be working together to keep everyone safe this holiday weekend. “We expect this to be one of the busiest nights of the year with people eager to gather together after a challenging time. We are all looking forward to celebrating in true Pittsburgh style with a grand fireworks display, but Public Safety’s primary focus will always be to protect residents and visitors so they can safely enjoy Independence Day with their families and friends,” said Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich. “To that end, there will be more than a dozen mobile light towers at key locations to increase visibility Downtown. The Pittsburgh Police, PA State Police, and Allegheny County Mounted Units will be activated to ensure crowds keep moving, allowing first responders to reach people should an emergency occur.” The City of Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh Police will not allow violence and unruly revelers to ruin what should be a safe event. Fights and violence of any kind will not be tolerated. Point State Park Rangers and Pittsburgh Police will be doing light bag screenings at the Park’s entrances. The list of prohibited items can be found on the event website: https://pittsburghpa.gov/july4/ The fireworks are scheduled to end at 10 p.m. and police will be working closely with Port Authority personnel to move people out of the downtown core as quickly as possible to decrease some of the past problems related to overcrowding in some areas at the end of the evening. Riders are strongly encouraged to check schedules in advance as some bus and rail routes do not operate, and most service ends early, on Sundays. Schedules can be found at www.portauthority.org/all-schedules. Bridges are often popular vantage points for vehicles to stop and watch the fireworks. A Pennsylvania State Police helicopter will monitor from overhead to ensure traffic keeps flowing on the bridge decks, reducing congestion and the possibility for collisions. Two River Rescue boats with Pittsburgh EMS, Police, and Fire personnel on board will be out on the rivers. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire boat will also be on the water with three firefighters. It should also be noted that the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural resources will close the Point State Park wharves to boat mooring on the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers on Sunday, July 4. Motorcycle medic units with the Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS will be operating near the various viewing points in the City to more easily reach and treat patients in crowded areas. Traditional medic units will also stage near key fireworks viewing points on Mount Washington, the North Side, and Downtown. One of the things they will be watching out for is heat-related ailments. Temperatures are forecast to be in the 80’s with mostly sunny skies on Independence Day. Dr. Donald Yealy, Chief Medical Officer with UPMC, says the most important thing to remember is that everyone’s body is a heat generator and we have to learn how to dissipate, or get rid of heat. “Things that either increase the amount of heat we are making or decrease our ability to get rid of the heat will put us at risk for having a complication, whether that is heat exhaustion or heat stroke,” says Yealy. “We become dehydrated from not drinking enough fluids or drinking the wrong fluids…alcohol is the wrong fluid as it goes out quickly. Certain medications can make us prone to either dehydration or less responsive to heat stresses. Those are things that either make us lose fluids or impair our ability to respond to heat.” The Public Safety Director would also like to remind people of the dangers that consumer grade fireworks pose. “Although sales of consumer fireworks are legal, they remain a fire hazard and a safety concern. As a reminder, fireworks are not allowed in Point State Park or any City park. In addition, the use of any fireworks, even those that are legal, are prohibited within 150 feet of any structure,” said Hissrich. “And please, remember your pets. Fireworks can startle pets, which are more sensitive to loud noises and flashing lights, sometimes causing them to run away or hide.” In an effort to curb the illegal use of fireworks, the Fireworks Task Force will continue with its enforcement efforts until July 5. And finally, although the situation has vastly improved, the pandemic is not over. Those who are not vaccinated are strongly encouraged to wear a mask. Even though Sunday's activities are primarily outdoors, the virus still poses a risk to those who are not inoculated with one of CDC-approved, COVID-19 vaccines. “This weekend will always involve a certain amount of congregation. That’s what people do during holidays. If you’re fully vaccinated, that’s not a concern. But if you’re not, please wear that mask. The COVID-19 virus is still here with us,” says Dr. Yealy.

The Department of Public Safety recognizes the slight inconvenience, but the overall goal of increased safety, overcrowded sidewalks and street traffic needed to be addressed,” said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich. . PITTSBURGH, PA (July 8, 2021) – When Lillie Leonardi, a 26-year veteran of law enforcement and former FBI Community Affairs Coordinator, lost her job and livelihood after being diagnosed with PTSD, she turned to intensive therapy, meditation, journaling, and reading books. A 9/11 first responder at the Flight 93 crash site in Shanksville, PA, books helped her heal and ultimately guided her toward a new career as an independent speaker, publisher, and founder of Passages & Prose, LLC and its non-profit subsidiary, Books Bridge Hope. “A wonderful life turned upside down by an unexpected, traumatic event…it’s a common story among the unsheltered community, but it could be anyone’s story,” Leonardi explains. “Through my community service work, past and present, I began to see that I had common ground with the homeless. I lost my job due to mental health issues. My fear was insurmountable. I couldn’t function well. That is the genesis of “Box of Goodness.” Since its launch in May of this year, Books Bridge Hope has distributed more than 50 boxes of goodness in partnership with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and its 25-member-strong team of Community Engagement officers. Officers now have the boxes in their vehicles to hand out to people where needed. “It’s an unfortunate reality, but Pittsburgh Police encounter our unsheltered community members throughout the City every single day, many of whom our officers know by name and try to assist with their differing and varying needs. But, sometimes receiving a gift; a surprise box full of items that lift a person’s soul and makes them smile, is just as important as helping provide some of the other critical care and assistance people need. That’s why the Pittsburgh Police Community Engagement Office jumped at the chance to partner with Books Bridge Hope – because that’s exactly what they do; they provide hope to those who need it most,” said Sergeant Tiffany Kline-Costa of the Community Engagement Office. Leonardi, who has personally funded the initiative since its inception, also works with an impassioned network of volunteers who help source and assemble contents for each box. Each Box of Goodness is filled to the brim with books, magazines, and writing supplies in direct response to countless requests for reading materials that help fill the long, empty hours on the street or in a shelter. Warm socks, toiletries and non-perishable food are also included. “This initiative not only provides compassionate care to the unsheltered community during these unprecedented times, but also allows law enforcement, the Books Bridge Hope Board of Directors, community collaborators, and volunteers to bring forth their best efforts in service to others,\" said Leonardi.

PITTSBURGH, PA, (August 12, 2021) -- In recent weeks, the City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety implemented a pilot project on the South Side to address mounting concerns regarding overcrowding, increased violence, and pedestrian safety on and around East Carson Street. The primary intent of the plan has been to stem the flow of vehicle traffic into the commercial corridor to alleviate some of the density in the area during the busiest evening hours on the weekends. While the strategy has been largely successful in helping to prevent violence and congestion on East Carson Street, Public Safety has remained in ongoing discussion with business owners who have asked for slight adjustments to ensure ease of access to restaurants and retail stores in the early evening hours. With that in mind, Public Safety is making modifications to the times of day during which the measures will be implemented. Beginning at 9:30 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, East Carson Street will convert from two-way to one-way traffic traveling eastbound (outbound) between S. 10th and S. 18th. The previous start time was 7:00 p.m. On Fridays and Saturdays, 'No Parking' measures will be strictly enforced on these blocks of East Carson Street starting at 8 p.m., including the towing of vehicles, to keep this stretch clear for Public Safety vehicle access. Signage along East Carson will be clearly marked to reflect the altered parking hours for these days. Side streets from S.11th to S.17th will remain open to through-traffic until 9:30 p.m., at which time vehicles will be diverted around those streets via either Muriel Street or Sarah Street. In previous weeks, the side streets were closed at 7:00 p.m. \"The only way to ensure the South Side will remain safe and accessible to everyone will be to continue to engage in communication with residents and business owners, working together and truly listening to their needs, balanced with the overall goal of preventing violence. That dialogue will be open and ongoing, and we continue to thank everyone for their patience and cooperation,\" said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich. The pilot project in the South Side will remain in effect for the near future and Public Safety will continue to monitor its impact and effectiveness. PITTSBURGH, PA, (August 13, 2021) -- Due to a partial building collapse in the 1600 block of E. Carson Street last night, Public Safety is temporarily halting its traffic calming pilot project. The upper level of a two-story building sustained severe damage during heavy rainstorms and engineers are concerned the integrity of the structure, and that of the adjacent buildings, may be compromised. As such, Public Safety will be closing E. Carson Street between S.16th and S.17th streets to begin the demolition of 1604 E. Carson. A large crane has been staged in the street to begin that process. During this time, traffic will be diverted around this block. Tractor trailers and longer industrial-type vehicles will need to divert via the 10th Street Bridge or the Birmingham Bridge. As stated earlier, the traffic pilot project implemented on July 30 will NOT be in place for the time being. Some businesses on this block will be impacted during the demolition. There is no timeline for its completion. This is an evolving situation and Public Safety will provide information to the public as it becomes available. Public Safety would like to thank residents, business owners, and visitors to Pittsburgh for their patience and understanding with these last minute changes and the inconvenience they may cause. PITTSBURGH, PA (August 19, 2021) – Following the partial collapse of a building located at 1604 E. Carson Street on August 12, engineers have been working to stabilize two adjacent buildings in order for the demolition of the affected structure to begin. During this week, E. Carson St. between S. 16th and S.17th Streets has been closed to vehicle and pedestrian traffic. After a successful stabilization and demolition, vehicle and pedestrian traffic resumed this afternoon. Barricades on the sidewalk and parking lane are still in place for the length of the affected structures. A reminder that Public Safety’s traffic pilot project implemented on July 30, and modified on August 12, will NOT be in effect for the time being. PITTSBURGH, PA (August 20, 2021) – With the start of the school year right around the corner, the Pittsburgh Police Community Engagement Office (CEO) turned its attention to the City’s students. On Friday, the Community Engagement Office and Chief Schubert participated in a backpack, supplies, and mask giveaway for students near Heinz Field in partnership with Pittsburgh Public Schools. All of the backpacks were handed out during the popular drive-up event and more than 600 masks were distributed. Earlier in the week, Sergeant Tiffany Kline-Costa and CEO officers spoke with children at Homewood YMCA about how to prepare and protect themselves in the event of an active shooter incident in their school. “Obviously police do not want to worry or scare young children, but we want them to have the tools and the knowledge to protect themselves and their classmates should such an incident occur. We tell them it’s much like doing regular fire drills to prepare for the possibility of a fire. It’s not likely to happen, but if does, they will know exactly what to do,” said Sergeant Kline-Costa. And finally, the Chess with Cops event in Market Square continues to draw new players every Tuesday and, as these photos demonstrate, the game doesn’t have to be a serious and somber affair! If you have an event you’d like the Community Engagement Office to participate in or an idea you’d like to share, please contact Sergeant Tiffany Kline-Costa at tiffany.kline-costa@pittsburghpa.gov. PITTSBURGH, PA, (August 25, 2021) – After a temporary delay due to a partial building collapse in the 1600 block of E. Carson St. on August 12, the Department of Public Safety is reestablishing its modified traffic pilot project on the South Side this upcoming weekend, August 27 – August 29. The primary intent of the plan has been to stem the flow of vehicle traffic into the commercial corridor to alleviate some of the density in the area during the busiest evening hours on the weekends. Ongoing discussion with business owners and residents has resulted in slight adjustments to the plan to ensure ease of access to restaurants and retail stores in the early evening hours. Public Safety has made modifications to the times of day during which the measures will be implemented.

PITTSBURGH, PA (August 26, 2021) – For the fourth year running, Pittsburgh Public Safety is proud to announce that the Pittsburgh Bureau of Emergency Medical Services has received the American Heart Association’s Mission: Lifeline EMS Gold Plus Achievement Award for implementation of quality care for severe heart attack and stroke patients. Program participants apply for the award recognition by demonstrating how their organization has committed to improving quality care for STEMI patients. An ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is the deadliest type of heart attack caused by a blockage of blood flow to the heart that requires urgent treatment. “As a paramedic for more than 40 years, I have watched Pittsburgh EMS evolve and innovate to the point that the City now has some of the most knowledgeable, well-trained, and best-equipped Paramedics and EMTs in the nation, and even the world. These first responders play a vital role in the continuum of care for cardiac and stroke patients, and they continue to expand on their skills and training daily,” said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich. Each year more than 250,000 people experience a STEMI heart attack and Pittsburgh EMS is uniquely qualified to provide optimal care for patients from the first 9-1-1 call, to treatment and transport, through to coordination with the healthcare system. “I am proud to work with our outstanding team of Emergency Medical Services caregivers who continue to provide the most up-to-date treatment to improve patient care and positive outcomes for Pittsburgh’s residents and visitors who experience cardiac emergencies,” said Ronald Romano, Chief of Pittsburgh EMS. The American Heart Association’s Mission: Lifeline EMS program helps reduce barriers to prompt treatment for heart attacks. “While the COVID-19 global pandemic continues to pose unique challenges with infected patients and the increased burden of additional personal protective equipment for first responders, Pittsburgh EMS Paramedics and EMTs have never wavered in their quality of care for cardiac care patients, relying on the Mission: Lifeline EMS guidelines and knowledge and putting that into practice each and every day,” said Pittsburgh EMS Assistant Chief, Mark Pinchalk.

PITTSBURGH, PA, ( September 3, 2021) -- After months of monitoring 9-1-1 calls and fielding citizen complaints regarding large groups of people riding off-road vehicles such as all-terrain vehicles (ATV’s) and dirt bikes recklessly on city streets, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, the Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office, the Allegheny County Sheriff’s Office and the University of Pittsburgh Police initiated a task force to investigate and prosecute these illegal so-called “ride-outs.\" The task force has identified the first of several suspects believed to have either participated in, organized, and/or promoted these dangerous events in Pittsburgh and surrounding areas. On the morning of September 2, police in Pittsburgh and law enforcement partners in neighboring municipalities served the following arrest warrants and confiscated 1 vehicle connected to illegal ride-out activities in Allegheny County: Austin Ross, 22, of Oakmont, PA is charged with Recklessly Endangering another Person, Riot, and Disorderly Conduct.

PITTSBURGH, PA (September 4, 2021) -- Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert has released the following statement on the passing of former Pittsburgh Steelers player and broadcaster, Tunch Ilkin: \"I am completely heartbroken and numb at the passing of Tunch Ilkin. I consider myself blessed to call him a friend and mentor. I’m a better cop and human being because of his unconditional love, faith, and guidance. My prayers are with the family and all who had the pleasure of knowing Tunch. He’s made an impact on the lives of so many people and Pittsburgh is a better place because of his love for humanity. I will forever remember how he lived his life and how he courageously battled ALS with hope, faith, love, and compassion. He never gave up and always put his faith in his savior the Lord. I take solace in knowing that he is finally at peace and his legacy will continue to make a difference in the lives of others. God bless, Tunch. You are loved and missed.\" --- Chief Scott Schubert, PIttsburgh Bureau of Police. PITTSBURGH, PA (September 11, 2021) – Twenty years have passed since the United States woke to the horror and disbelief of witnessing coordinated terror attacks on the nation. As hijacked planes struck the World Trade Center in New York City, the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and crashed into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, the United States, and indeed the world, shared in the collective grief that still reverberates two decades on. Close to 3,000 people lost their lives that day. Thousands of first responders rushed without hesitation to aid the victims and rescue survivors. More than 400 of them would never return home. Nearly as many later died from 9/11-related conditions. Currently, there are tens of thousands of first responders enrolled in the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s 9/11 World Trade Center Health Program who are still being treated for illnesses linked to their response that day. “Pittsburgh Public Safety honors the memory of those who lost their lives and the brave men and women – the first responders - who rushed toward multiple, unforeseen dangers on 9/11. They willingly risked their lives to help, search for, and rescue perfect strangers. They never faltered in their mission or questioned their own safety. This solemn anniversary offers an opportunity to reflect on their heroism and express our gratitude. They made the ultimate sacrifice. We thank all first responders for carrying on their legacy of service and selflessness,” --Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich. We shall never forget. PITTSBURGH, PA (September 14, 2021) – On the morning of Sunday, September 12, officers with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police were dispatched to two separate Catholic churches in the City of Pittsburgh after threats to harm congregants were received by telephone. At the same time, parishioners at one of the churches, located on the North Side, called Police after one of their fellow congregants was observed to be carrying a gun on his person during the service. During their initial investigation, the man provided police with a valid conceal carry permit. It was determined that he did not commit a crime and was permitted to leave. The other church that received a threat was in the Greenfield area of the City. When responding officers arrived, they secured the scene and established that there was no visible threat inside or outside of the church before the congregants were escorted to safety. In response to these threats and perceived danger, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is working directly with the FBI to thoroughly investigate the source and determine any connection between the two incidents. \"Pittsburgh Public Safety takes all threats of violence or terrorism extremely seriously. Pittsburgh Police Intelligence Unit detectives are working closely with our federal partners within FBI Pittsburgh, sharing information and intelligence to determine the origin of the threats. In the meantime, we are reassured that in one instance, citizens called Police when they observed suspicious behavior. We encourage everyone to adhere to the tenet, ‘if you see something, say something.’ It is only by working together that we can keep our communities safe,” said Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich. Police have added extra patrols and are taking additional precautions to safeguard these churches and all houses of worship in the City of Pittsburgh. The Bureau does not discuss specific operational details. This investigation is very active and ongoing. Updates to the public will be provided when they become available.

PITTSBURGH, PA ( September 24, 2021) – Officers with the Pittsburgh Police Community Engagement Office kicked off the week’s activities – and the fall season – in the most 'Pittsburgh' kind of way, by taking in the Steelers home opener at Heinz Field on Sunday. But, they didn’t do it alone. Families from the South Side organization, Voices Against Violence, joined officers for a great day starting with a tailgate meal at Stage AE before the game. The initiative to connect Pittsburgh Police with children, youth, and community groups around the City to enjoy Steelers home games together was originally imagined by retired Pittsburgh Steeler, Markice Pouncey. The tradition will continue thanks to Steelers defensive lineman, Stephon Tuitt, who has picked up the mantle. “On behalf of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and the communities we serve, I am extremely grateful to Stephon Tuitt for volunteering to keep our Pittsburgh Steelers and Community Engagement partnership alive. This relationship has grown and flourished as our officers and youth spend time together in a safe, relaxed and fun setting. As a result, a mutual trust, understanding and respect has developed,” said Police Chief, Scott Schubert. On Tuesday, CEO Officer Chelsey Washington helped deliver food to the Light of Life Mission on the North Side thanks to a generous donation from the Catholic Community Food Bank of Troy Hill. And even as temperatures dip, the die-hard chess aficionados still turn up in impressive numbers for the weekly Chess with Cops event each Tuesday in Market Square. Also this week, Community Engagement officers were afforded a unique training opportunity through the Senator John Heinz History Center to privately tour two curated exhibits, 'From Freedom to Slavery' and 'American Democracy,' where they were able to ask questions of the exhibit's curator and engage in discussion. If you have an event you’d like the Community Engagement Office to participate in or an idea you’d like to share, please contact Sergeant Tiffany Kline-Costa at tiffany.kline-costa@pittsburghpa.gov. PITTSBURGH, PA (September 27, 2021) -- It is with extremely heavy hearts and profound sadness that the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police announces the sudden loss of one of its own on Sunday evening, September 26, 2021. Officer Brian Rowland, age 47, was surrounded by his loving family when he passed away at St. Clair Hospital following a brief illness. Officer Rowland was a 21-year veteran of the force, working in Zone 6 in the City's West End. \"I am deeply saddened by the loss of a dedicated veteran officer and a loyal friend to many in the Bureau.

We serve together, we mourn together, and we will help each other through this together...as a family,\" said Police Chief, Scott Schubert. Commander Cristyn Zett supervised Officer Rowland in Zone 6. \"I met Brian nearly 22 years ago when we were classmates in the police academy. He was a no-nonsense guy who devoted his entire adult life to protecting and serving the residents of Pittsburgh. Brian was a devoted husband, a huge dog lover, a fitness enthusiast, a friend, and mentor to countless officers. He was always the person you wanted next to you in an emergency. His death leaves a huge void in the police bureau, and he will be missed deeply,\" said Commander Zett. Brian Rowland is survived by his wife Krista and fur-babies Echo, Kimber, and Jinxy Cat. The Bureau asks that the media respect the family's privacy during this difficult time. Funeral arrangements will be announced at a later date.

PITTSBURGH, PA, (September 30, 2021) – In the last week of July, Public Safety introduced a traffic pilot project in the busy South Side corridor in an effort to ease vehicle congestion, improve pedestrian safety, and mitigate an increase in violence in the area on weekend evenings. Thanks to the cooperation and patience of businesses and residents in the area, Public Safety is satisfied that these measures have resulted in several positive improvements. As a result, beginning on Friday, October 1, 2021, traffic on East Carson Street will convert back to two-way traffic between S.10th and S.18th Streets in the evenings. On Fridays and Saturdays, 'No Parking' measures will still be strictly enforced on these blocks of East Carson Street starting at 8 p.m., including the towing of vehicles, to keep this stretch of road clear for Public Safety vehicle access. In addition to the traffic pattern shifts implemented in July, Pittsburgh Police increased the number of officers in the area and expanded enforcement. Over the past four weekends, Police working in the South Side corridor have made 12 arrests, one firearms-related arrest, one firearm seizure, issued 371 citations, and towed 69 vehicles. These enhanced enforcement measures will remain in place. “The Department of Public Safety is pleased with the progress that has been made to increase safety on the South Side. As promised, we engaged in regular discussions with residents and businesses during this time to share ideas on the impact and effectiveness of the pilot program and the stepped-up enforcement. We thank everyone for their patience and participation in this effort. It wasn't always easy to balance competing needs, but we are grateful for the partnerships that helped make this happen,\" said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich. Public Safety will continue to monitor the South Side in the interest of keeping residents and visitors safe while they enjoy the many benefits this unique district has to offer.

[...] We need to do everything we can for our officers to allow them to be successful, and to be safe out in the field. And I know you’re going to be a big part of that.” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich applauded the officers’ work that has often transcended traditional police work during the pandemic. “I see officers being plumbers, auto mechanics, social workers, Uber drivers and many other occupations day in and day out,” he said. “I have watched you provide direction and guidance to your officers as you were once mentored.” Mayor William Peduto commended the officers for their leadership, perseverance and ability to adapt to change. “I want to thank you personally, first of all, for wanting to take on more responsibility. I want to thank you for wanting to take on the added responsibility of taking care of yourselves and taking care of your brothers and sisters.” Commander Shawn Malloy is assigned to Zone 1, Commander Matthew Lackner is assigned to Zone 2, Commander Martin Devine is assigned to Narcotics and Vice, Commander Richard Ford is assigned to Major Crimes, and Commander Ronald Griffin is assigned to Zone 4. Lieutenants will finish their current assignments as the Department completes a bid process. PITTSBURGH, PA (October 20, 2021) -- Pharmaceutical or prescription drugs can be just as dangerous as unregulated substances, because addiction can oftentimes begin with what’s inside your medicine cabinet. In 2019, nearly 10 million Americans misused controlled prescription drugs, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Nearly 5% of children ages 12 to 17 have reported non-medical drug use over the past year, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Together with the Drug Enforcement Administration, Pittsburgh is working towards making the community safer, starting at home. On Saturday, October 23 from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m., Pittsburgh will participate in the Drug Enforcement Administration’s 21st Annual Prescription Drug Takeback Day. In April, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police collected 34 boxes with a combined total weight of 672 pounds of prescription medications. Nationally, 420 tons of expired or unused medications were collected at over 5,000 collection sites. “Many people may not realize the proper disposal of unused or expired prescription drugs can actually save lives,” said Sergeant Rebecca Bassano, Pittsburgh Police Narcotics and Vice. “Dropping off pill bottles at a disposal location can prevent them from getting into the wrong hands.” Expired or unused prescription drugs can be a public safety hazard leading to poisoning, accidental overdoses, or abuse. Proper disposal can also protect the environment. All expired, unused, and unwanted prescription drugs can be dropped off at the following locations this Saturday: Zone 1: 1501 Brighton Rd, 15212 Zone 2: 2000 Centre Ave, 15219 Zone 3: 830 E Warrington Ave, 15210 Zone 4: 5858 Northumberland St, 15217 Zone 5: 1401 Washington Blvd, 15206 Zone 6: 312 South Main St, 15220 Police Headquarters: 1203 Western Ave, 15233 For those who can’t participate this weekend, permanent drop-off boxes are located at Pittsburgh Police Headquarters and Zone 6. For more information about the safe disposal of prescription drugs or about the October 23rd Take Back Day event, visit www.DEATakeBack.com. PITTSBURGH, PA, (October 21, 2021) -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police family is deeply saddened to announce the death of one of its own.

He also volunteered many times for various Special Olympics events. He was a good man, cop, father, and husband. He will be missed dearly,\" said Chief Schubert. Sergeant Howe is survived by his wife Cali, son Josh, and daughters, Faith and Christine. Funeral arrangements will be announced at a later date. PITTSBURGH, PA (October 27, 2021) – The City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety commemorates the third anniversary of the attack on the Tree of Life Congregation in Squirrel Hill. On Saturday, October 27, 2018, the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in American history claimed the lives of 11 community members who gathered for worship on a cool and rainy fall morning. “Pittsburgh was irrevocably changed that day. The relative peace we knew and enjoyed as a city was suddenly shattered. But on the days and months that followed, people came together like never before to support one another and to heal. It was the Tree of Life tragedy where Pittsburghers truly embodied the phrase, ‘Stronger than hate,’” said Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich. Pittsburgh Public Safety honors the innocent men and women who lost their lives that day, and the first responders who were injured while answering the call to this senseless tragedy. PITTSBURGH, PA (November 2, 2021) -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is mourning the loss of a veteran member of the force today.

The 60th anniversary of the festival marks the unofficial start to the holiday season in Pittsburgh with multiple events taking place Downtown, culminating in a fireworks finale at 9:30 p.m. from the Allegheny Overlook on Ft. Duquesne Boulevard. “Like most Pittsburghers, I am looking forward to the return of Light Up Night after the traditional event was cancelled due to the pandemic last year. As such, City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety personnel from all of the bureaus will be in place to help provide a safe and fun experience for everyone in what is expected to be a large turnout,” said Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will work with partnering law enforcement agencies -- including the Allegheny County Sheriff’s Office, Allegheny County Police, Pennsylvania State Police, Port Authority Police and State Park Rangers -- to provide uniformed and plainclothes officers throughout the venues. With the Pitt Panthers afternoon game scheduled at Heinz Field, Public Safety will also be working with University of Pittsburgh Police. Pittsburgh Police Mounted and Motorcycle Units will be in place, as will River Rescue and the Fire Boat, Pittsburgh EMS, Pittsburgh Fire and Emergency Management. The Pennsylvania State Police helicopter will be providing aerial support. A number of light towers will be erected Downtown in addition to the ones already positioned on the South Side, where an increased police presence remains on busy weekend evenings. City cameras will also be fully operational. As can be expected, traffic and parking will be a challenge Downtown. Attendees should consider ride-sharing or public transit options. The weather is forecast to be seasonable with temperatures in the mid-to-high 40s and minimal probability of precipitation. Police remind the public that drones are not allowed, nor are illegal weapons. In addition, city law prohibits the use of any fireworks, even those that are legal, within 150 feet of a structure. “We hope residents and visitors will come down and take part in one of the City’s most festive events of the year, but we encourage everyone to do so safely and to be mindful that we are still in the midst of a global pandemic,” said Hissrich. Public Safety wishes everyone a happy, healthy, and safe holiday season. PITTSBURGH, PA (November 23, 2021) - In an effort to minimize accidental shootings and help all residents be responsible gun owners, The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is providing free gun locks for all members of the public while supplies last. The locks are available at all zones within the city, and at Police Headquarters on Western Avenue. Gun locks are a crucial part of the effort to curb accidental shootings by preventing children from discharging a firearm and injuring themselves or others. Oftentimes, effort by parents or guardians to obtain a gun lock and properly secure a gun can prevent tragedy. “Taking five to ten minutes to place the lock on a gun could potentially save a life,” said Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich. “That’s what we’re trying to get out to the public today, that these locks are available.” Hissrich added that learning to use a gun lock is a simple process. The device laces through the magazine chamber into the ejection port before locking in place. Keys should always be kept away from children or placed in a secured location, like a vault. To view a demonstration on proper use of a gun lock, click here. Those who would like to obtain a gun lock can pick one up at the following locations: Police Headquarters 1203 Western Ave Pittsburgh, PA 15233 412-323-7800 Zone 1 Police Station 1501 Brighton Road Pittsburgh, PA 15212 412-323-7201 Zone 2 Police Station 2000 Centre Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15219 412-255-2827 Zone 3 Police Station 830 East Warrington Avenue Pittsburgh, PA 15210 412-488-8326 Zone 4 Police Station 5858 Northumberland Street Pittsburgh, PA 15217 412-422-6520 Zone 5 Police Station 1401 Washington Blvd Pittsburgh, PA 15206 412-665-3605 Zone 6 Police Station 312 S. Main Street Pittsburgh PA 15220 412-937-3051 PITTSBURGH, PA (November 29, 2021) - On Monday, November 29, the Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS held a swearing-in and promotions ceremony in the Mayor’s conference room. Jeffrey Tremel was promoted to district chief, while Nicholas Lawrence and Justin M. Miller were promoted and sworn in as crew chiefs. EMS Chief Ronald Romano commended all three on their outstanding effort and dedication which earned them their distinguished titles within department leadership. \"I want to thank these three individuals for having the ambition to pursue these promotions, and to continue to be leaders in the Bureau of EMS now and in the future,\" said Romano. Medical Director for the City of Pittsburgh Dr. Ronald Roth congratulated the chiefs, emphasizing the importance of leadership in a time of change. “This is really a time where we need leaders,” said Roth. “We know that Pittsburgh EMS has a good moral compass. We know which direction we want to go. And with good leaders, we can make that happen.” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich praised the strong leadership already provided by the incoming crew chiefs in stressful, often chaotic situations in the field. “The crew chiefs are the ones that are making life and death decisions daily,” he said. Hissrich also addressed the extensive career of Jeffrey Tremel, who has served over 32 years with Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS in the Ambulance and Rescue Divisions. Tremel also served as President of Local 1 of the Fraternal Association of Professional Paramedics. Hissrich said Tremel’s leadership, combined with a joint effort with the Mayor’s Office, was key in the Public Safety Department’s effort to restore the EMT system, as well as ensure better pay and improved working conditions for paramedics. “During the COVID pandemic, it was through the leadership of Jeff and his Executive Board of the paramedic union we were able to make lives easier, save lives and have a back-up plan in case we realized a situation where many of the medics and EMTs became ill and unable to work.” Before administering the oath of office, Mayor William Peduto commended the new chiefs and spoke of their importance in both recruitment and retention of future first-responders. “We found a way to do great things. I am so proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with you these past eight years,” said Peduto. “As we look at these promotions, we’re looking into the next ten years, because it’s going to be hard to find qualified leaders in order to be able to train a next generation. It’s going to be hard [...] to find people willing to put their lives at risk in order to help and serve others, and it will require a strong leadership in order to be able to make sure there are people out there to help to serve, and save, Pittsburghers.” PITTSBURGH, PA (November 30, 2021)—Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire held a promotions ceremony in the Mayor’s Conference Room this afternoon. Bernard Mohan was promoted to Deputy Chief Ronald Bollinger promoted to Battalion Chief. Two firefighters, Brian Krull and Jason Marino were promoted to the rank of Captain.

Congratulations to new Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Deputy Chief, Battalion Chief, Captains, and Lieutenants! PITTSBURGH, PA (December 1, 2021) - After a thorough investigation, Pittsburgh Police plain clothes detectives from Zone 5 recently made an arrest in two illegal trash dumping incidents. On July 28 and August 1 of this year, City cameras recorded the same individual unloading truckloads of trash on Renfrew Street in Larimer, a site that is not designated for the legal disposal of refuse. As a result, Pittsburgh Police identified and issued a warrant for a 60-year-old man from North Versailles, PA. He was charged with two counts of Theft of Services and two counts of Scattering Rubbish. The Peduto Administration has long-prioritized the enforcement of illegal dumping and littering, which has been an ongoing blight in City neighborhoods. \"The practice of illegally discarding trash is not only an eyesore that diminishes the beauty of Pittsburgh neighborhoods, it's a crime that costs Pennsylvania taxpayers approximately $68 million dollars in mitigation each year,\" said Mayor William Peduto. Back in August, the Mayor's Office joined the Department of Public Works and the Clean Pittsburgh Commission to announce the City’s Goals on Littering and Dumping (GOLD) Plan for eradicating litter and illegal dumping citywide. Pittsburgh has more than 800 known illegal dumping sites and the City has made investments to strengthen enforcement efforts. Through a financial commitment from the Clean Pittsburgh Commission, new high resolution cameras have been placed at known dumping sites. The City of Pittsburgh would like to remind residents and visitors that the practice of discarding trash outside of designated areas is illegal and will not be tolerated. \"We thank the Mayor's Office for making the eradication of these crimes a priority, and the Pittsburgh Police for investigating and holding offenders accountable,\" said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich. Learn more about the City's Goals and Littering and Dumping (GOLD) Plan: https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/5203# PITTSBURGH, PA, (December 3, 2021) – On Saturday, December 4, the University of Pittsburgh Panthers will take on the Wake Forest Demon Deacons in the ACC Football Championship in Charlotte, North Carolina. In anticipation of the 8 p.m. game, the Department of Public Safety is making preparations for what is expected to draw large numbers of fans for watch parties and celebrations, particularly in Oakland and the South Side entertainment district. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, with assistance from the University of Pittsburgh Police and the Pennsylvania State Police Mounted Unit, will have extra officers on patrol, along with its Mounted, Motorcycle, Bicycle and K-9 units. Temporary light towers will be placed in busy areas that may require additional lighting. “We appreciate that this is a big game for Pitt and that many more fans than usual will likely be coming out to support the team and hopefully celebrate a win. However, there will be zero tolerance for property damage or violence of any kind and police will be on high alert for impaired drivers,” said Public Safety Director, Wendell Hissrich. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire and the Bureau of EMS will also be providing additional resources and personnel on game day. The Department of Public Safety encourages everyone to celebrate responsibly. PITTSBURGH, PA, (December 21, 2021) – On Wednesday, October 13, 2021, Jim Rogers was placed in Pittsburgh Bureau of Police (PBP) custody after officers responded to a call in Bloomfield. The officer on scene deployed his Taser during the response. Following his arrest, Mr. Rogers was transported to Mercy Hospital by police, where he passed away the following day. Pursuant to policy, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police empaneled an internal Critical Incident Review Board (CIRB) to evaluate officers’ actions and gauge policy compliance. Additionally, the Allegheny County Police Department is independently investigating the incident with the full cooperation of the PBP. Over the course of two months, the CIRB has reviewed evidence including all available video, officer statements and Pittsburgh Bureau of Police general orders and training. The Board found that a series of procedural failures contributed to this tragic outcome. Eight Pittsburgh Bureau of Police officers, including two supervisors, will face varying levels of discipline in accordance with the Fraternal Order of Police collective bargaining agreement. We are not permitted to discuss details of the disciplinary process. In recent years, the City of Pittsburgh implemented several measures to ensure accountability, including mandatory de-escalation and implicit bias training for officers and participation in The National Initiative for Building Community Trust & Justice, which examines policy and aims to increase trust within our community. However, it is clear more needs to be done. Therefore, the CIRB recommended the following policy and procedural changes: Any use of force incident will require the presence of a supervisor on scene to complete a medical assessment and request appropriate personnel Any incident involving the positive deployment of a Taser will require emergency medical services personnel to assess the patient Pittsburgh Bureau of Police personnel will be retrained in accordance with established PBP Training Academy Duty to Intervene policy PBP will streamline its organizational review of Use of Force by both appropriate command staff and the Training Academy to expeditiously ensure policy compliance “It is imperative that every critical incident is reviewed promptly,” said Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich. “By identifying the problem, it allows us to make corrections that are put into policy in a timely manner.” Immediately following this incident, all sworn PBP officers were required to complete a Taser refresher course followed by an exam. This course is in addition to the yearly mandated Taser recertification requirement for all officers. Further, the PBP will require its officers to become fully certified Emergency Medical Responders. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police would like to express its most sincere condolences to the family and friends of Mr. Jim Rogers. We thank them for their patience in affording the CIRB the time and latitude to investigate the events that led up to his tragic death. “Jim Rogers will serve as a sober reminder of the tremendous responsibility all officers bear when they wear the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police badge. Every resident and visitor to the City of Pittsburgh is owed the highest standard of care when they are in the custody of Pittsburgh Police. In the case of Jim Rogers, we failed our fellow citizen. The disciplinary measures and procedural changes we are announcing today are intended to ensure a tragedy such as this never occurs again in the City of Pittsburgh,” said Police Chief, Scott Schubert. Pittsburgh Public Safety will not be offering any further comment at this time.

We've seen lots of change, and even trying times together; and hopefully we were able to make a positive difference over these past six years. It has been my privilege to serve the City and help work towards a safer Pittsburgh for everyone.\" -Wendell Hissrich, Public Safety Director As of now, he says he has no current plans to announce regarding the future. PITTSBURGH, PA (Dec. 30, 2021) – After a moderated “made-for-TV” format last year, Pittsburgh’s annual “First Night” returns to the streets and event venues of Pittsburgh to ring in 2022. Dec. 31 traditionally draws tens of thousands of people to the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s Highmark First Night Pittsburgh celebrations at venues throughout Downtown. Last year, those crowds stayed home due to pandemic concerns, but this year organizers are adapting the event again by moving much of it outdoors. Of course, COVID-19 is still at the forefront of many minds, given the emergence of the Omicron variant. This year, there are some new requirements to keep crowds safe. Proof of vaccination, a valid ID and a mask are required for admission at any indoor venue. “There are ways to both stay safe and have fun,” said Medical Director for the City of Pittsburgh Dr. Ronald Roth. “Even if you are fully vaccinated, wear a proper mask when inside or outside if you will be within close proximity of others from outside your own household.” Further, a proper fitting, three-layer surgical-type mask is a better choice than a cloth mask. As always, proper social distancing is suggested where possible. First Night is a long-standing family-friendly tradition and members of the Pittsburgh Police and Public Safety will be on-hand to help ensure residents and visitors are able to celebrate in a safe environment. “As always, we encourage people to celebrate responsibly,” said PBP Police Chief Scott Schubert. “Public Safety officials will be highly visible and we encourage participants to engage with our personnel if they are in need of assistance or directions. Safety is everyone’s responsibility, so if you see something, say something!” As a reminder, Police urge people to never drink and drive. Use public transportation or Uber, Lyft and designated drivers. Police will actively be looking for impaired drivers throughout the night. For more information on First Night celebrations, go to firstnightpgh.trustarts.org. PITTSBURGH, PA (January 27, 2022) – The Department of Public Safety is pleased to welcome President Joe Biden and members of his administration to Pittsburgh this Friday, January 28. During his brief stay in the city, President Biden will be visiting the research and development hub, Mill 19, in Hazelwood. Pittsburgh Police Commander Eric Holmes oversees dignitary protection for national and international leaders when they visit Pittsburgh. He says residents and visitors should expect temporary traffic disruptions as the President’s motorcade moves from Allegheny County Airport to Hazelwood. “Drivers should prepare for rolling traffic delays and detours, as well as restricted parking along 2nd Avenue between the Glenwood Bridge and Hazelwood Avenue for the planned event. It is advisable to pack a measure of patience and prepare ahead with an alternative route in mind to minimize travel hurdles,” said Holmes. Residents who live on or visit the following streets will also experience parking and travel interruptions: 'No Parking' signs will be posted 24 hours in advance of the visit and restrictions will be in place from 7 a.m. until 4 p.m. on Friday, January 28. PITTSBURGH, PA (January. 28, 2022) – At 6:39 a.m. on January 28, rescue crews responded to the Forbes Avenue Bridge in Frick Park after the bridge collapsed near Forbes and South Braddock. Five vehicles and one Port Authority bus were on the bridge at the time. Ten people were evaluated and treated for minor injuries, including some first responders. Three people were transported to local hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries. “I am thankful for the quick response and dedication of the Pittsburgh Public Safety Department, and for the cooperation and assistance of the county, state, and federal governments,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. Rescue operations concluded just after 8:30 a.m. “Due to the scale of the collapse, we activated the mass casualty plan,” said Chief Darryl Jones, Emergency Management Coordinator for EMA. “Thank you to all our partners at all levels for their assistance and work as we continue to navigate this scene.” Response included Allegheny County and Pennsylvania State authorities. The Pennsylvania State Police provided a UAV drone to scan the collapse site for situational awareness purposes. Ross/Westview and Baldwin EMS were also on scene. Jones activated Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) assets to search for possible victims underneath the collapsed bridge, which is where crews will now focus their efforts. PA USAR Strike Team 1 will work to check for void spaces under the bridge. “First responders worked quickly and effectively together, sharing resources and information,” said acting Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt, “their diligence ensured everyone on the bridge was safe.” Additionally, the collapse ruptured gas lines that ran along the bridge, causing a large gas leak. Gas crews shut the gas off within thirty minutes. Several families were evacuated from their homes nearby as a precaution and have since been cleared for re-entry. The cause of the collapse is under investigation. Frick Park is closed to pedestrians and vehicles as crews continue their work.

PITTSBURGH, PA (February 2, 2022) - Following the January 28 collapse of the Fern Hollow Bridge in Frick Park, the City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) has worked expeditiously with PennDOT to secure a contractor to work on remediation and eventual reconstruction, as well as to support the NTSB investigation. The contractor has begun staging large pieces of equipment on Forbes Avenue and will continue to do so in the coming days and weeks. As a result, the public viewing area that was created this week on the Squirrel Hill side of the collapse site on Forbes Avenue will be closed indefinitely, effective immediately. In the interest of protecting the public, pedestrians and vehicles will not be allowed on the stretch of Forbes off of S. Dallas leading to the site. DOMI will continue to monitor traffic flow in the area and make adjustments to signal timing as needed. In the meantime, for pedestrians using Frick Park, Tranquil Trail is still closed within a 100 yard perimeter of the collapse site. Undercliff Trail is also closed. Clayton Loop, Biddle Trail, and Homewood Trail remain open. Public Safety understands how important Frick Park and the surrounding areas are to Pittsburgh residents and visitors. We thank everyone for their continued patience and understanding as all parties work to support the investigation and eventually rebuild the Fern Hollow Bridge. PITTSBURGH, PA (February 11, 2022) – Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire held its graduation ceremony Friday for Recruit Class 131-21. The ceremony was held at The Teamster Temple in Lawrenceville. 28 recruits make up the latest class joining the ranks of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire. Of those, family connections to PBF are strong: one is a third generation firefighter and eight are second generation. There are two military veterans among them. The Bureau itself boasts firefighters from diverse backgrounds, including former chefs, police officers, scientists, paramedics, and more – which works well to prepare them for the unique challenges of firefighting. “Firefighters today are expected to respond to everything from fire alarms to structure fires, medical emergencies to hazardous materials situations, from swift water rescues to vehicle extrication,” said President of Pittsburgh Fire Fighters IAFF Local No. 1 Ralph Sicuro . “And remember, firefighting is still one of the few professions that makes house calls.” In addition to the experience they already bring to the table, recruits endure an intensive, 32 week program to prepare them for the hazards and challenges of the job. “I daresay these recruits are the best trained, most physically fit, most street-ready to ever emerge from any fire academy in the country,” said Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Chief Darryl Jones. “We are very proud of that fact.” Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt spoke of the community that often forms with the job. “You have a whole group of other fellow firefighters that are here to support you. Some days are going to be harder than others, but you can persevere and you can make it through as long as you have the support that you need.” Mayor Ed Gainey administered the Oath of Office after calling for a standing ovation and thanking families. “To the families, I want to say ‘thank you.’ Thank you, because at the end of the day, I know you watched them grow as they arrived at this moment. We know the power of love and support and what it does. Thank you for your dedication to making them believe in themselves.” After being granted the traditional weekend off after graduation by Chief Jones, firefighters will begin work with their platoons next week. PITTSBURGH, PA (March 4, 2022) – Pittsburgh Bureau of Emergency Medical Services held a swearing-in ceremony Friday for EMTs and paramedics. The ceremony was held in Council Chambers at the City-County Building. Three new EMTs and ten paramedics were sworn in during the ceremony. One paramedic received a promotion. Romi Chaouk, Williams McHenry and Logan Ondos were sworn in as EMTs. Robert Catley, Willem deBoer, Ryan Kesting, Zachary Koenecke, Brandon Prevost, Samuel Rest, Andrew Schartner, Michael Schmidt, Cameron Rogers and Graham Weston were sworn in as paramedics. Paramedic Edward Parker was promoted. Kicking off the ceremony, EMS Chief Ronald Romano directly addressed the families. “Thank you for supporting them in the work they do for the city’s citizens. Thank you for sharing them with us and understanding when they miss a family event because they are helping someone else.” Medical Director for the City of Pittsburgh Dr. Ronald Roth cited the foundational and revolutionary history of emergency care in Pittsburgh by the Freedom House Ambulance Service. Established in 1967, it was the first emergency medical service to provide training beyond basic first aid. The team of mostly Black paramedics set the standard for emergency care not only for future Pittsburgh paramedics, but programs around the country. “This legacy continues today,” he said. “Not satisfied with that success, Pittsburgh EMS is on the forefront of treating victims of opioid overdose. We actually start treating victims in the field. We are one of only three or four other agencies in the country to do this.” Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt connected that past with the new potential in the Bureau of EMS. “You are now a part of that history. I want you to think about the future, and think about what we as Pittsburgh can continue to do to create new pathways for EMS and care for the people we serve. I want you to think of new, innovative ideas that we can implement. Bring those ideas forward.” After administering the oaths of office, Mayor Ed Gainey encouraged the newest members of Pittsburgh EMS to lean on each other, and commended them for their heart to serve the city. “As you serve each other, you will be able to serve the public with greater respect, love, admiration,and tolerance. You will help us build a city that is welcoming.” PITTSBURGH, PA (March 10, 2022) – Following two years of subdued celebrations due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, Pittsburgh Public Safety is anticipating a more robust turnout this St. Patrick’s Day. Larger-than-usual crowds are expected to gather for the full return of the annual parade. In addition, the traditional post-parade gathering spots on the South Side, Downtown and North Shore are also likely to see a return to pre-pandemic crowd sizes as Covid-19 mitigation measures such as mask-usage and social distancing ease across the United States. “After two very challenging years, it’s understandable that people will be in the mood to celebrate one of Pittsburgh’s more beloved traditions; St. Patrick’s Day,” said Public Safety Director, Lee Schmidt. “We encourage everyone to have fun and enjoy the day, but to do so safely, remaining mindful that while the worst of the pandemic appears to have waned at this moment, it has not disappeared entirely.” Director Schmidt reminds everyone that disruptive and illegal behavior will not be tolerated. Pittsburgh Police and its County and State law enforcement partners will be monitoring crowds for underage drinking, public intoxication, and drinking and driving. Officers from the Pittsburgh Police Mounted, Motorcycle, Bicycle and K9 units will be assisting zone officers on regular patrol. Temporary light towers will be positioned in the busiest club and restaurant districts to provide an additional level of security. A reminder that it is illegal to consume alcohol in unlicensed public spaces. Open container laws will be strictly enforced. Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire officials and the PA Liquor Control Board will conduct occupancy checks and clear and close any establishment that exceeds occupancy limits. In addition, paramedics and EMTs from the Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS will be staging near celebration spots around the City. Most importantly, please do not drink and drive. We urge everyone to use alternatives such as a designated driver, public transportation, taxis or ride-sharing platforms. Drivers are reminded to use proper pullover areas so as to keep lanes clear for public safety access. Those drivers who stop and block traffic will be cited. If you do plan to drive, please slow down and use extra care on the roads as an accumulation of between 3-6 inches of snow is predicted. As always, Pittsburgh Public Safety encourages everyone to report any suspicious activity to 9-1-1 and to celebrate safely and responsibly. PITTSBURGH, PA (March 22, 2022) – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is pleased to announce its partnership with and participation in the OneCOP (One Congregation, One Precinct) program to strengthen ties between police and the communities they serve. The national initiative coming to Pittsburgh was created by the Atlanta-based social change organization, MovementForward, Inc. OneCOP is the organization’s signature program which facilitates positive, ongoing partnerships between local law enforcement agencies and diverse congregations of every faith tradition. This includes organizing various crime and violence prevention-solving efforts, hosting public safety briefings, providing cultural and sensitivity training, conducting officer appreciation events, holding community safety workshops and hosting forums focused on improving the relationship between police and citizens. “The OneCOP initiatve is a cutting-edge enhancement to the community outreach that our law enforcement community has long engaged in. In our continuing efforts to build and expand upon existing relationships with the citizens we serve, we appeal to every faith leader who presides over a congregation to learn more and potentially join in this partnership,” said Police Chief Scott Schubert. “During a crisis is not when relationships are built. Rather, it’s when relationships grow and become established through a commitment to open conversations happening routinely before the crisis occurs, that makes all the difference.” MovementForward Inc. CEO Reverend Markel Hutchins says the OneCOP program is a holistic approach to easing tensions and building trust between the police and the community. “Police reform will not happen overnight, and the long-term solution will require a substantial effort to address the grievances and negative perceptions civilians have about law enforcement. Collaborations between police agencies and local groups, especially faith-based organizations, are invaluable force-multipliers for creating safer and more engaged neighborhoods.” For the launch of OneCOP in Pittsburgh, media members are invited to attend an inaugural luncheon on Thursday, March 24 at the IBEW Local Union 5. In advance of the luncheon, on Wednesday, March 23, Pittsburgh Police and MovementForward, Inc. will gather a select group of prominent local business, civic and faith-based community leaders to participate in mock training exercises at the Pittsburgh Police Training Academy. Attendees will experience in-person, officer-civilian reality-based scenarios, including traffic stops and an introduction to the firearms simulator. Media is invited to attend and capture visuals of the training stations throughout the afternoon. Interviews with Pittsburgh Police and MovementForward, Inc. will be possible at the 4:15 p.m. news conference. Details below: Training Day Date and time: Wednesday, March 23 at 12 p.m. Location: Pittsburgh Police Training Academy 900 N.

In a matter of five days, there have been three shootings that have taken the lives of three young people, aggravated assaults, multiple shots fired, and now, two children, two young boys, have suffered critical stabbing injuries. While the number of violent crimes has been rising around the United States since 2020 and the onset of the pandemic, this is an oversimplified explanation. This is unacceptable in Pittsburgh. This is not reflective of the city we know and love. People are clearly hurting. As the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, we strive daily to work with all of our communities to build a safer, more equitable city for everyone. Our officers will investigate all crimes, but we are also there to help, listen, and connect people with valuable social services before a crisis occurs. We urge citizens to utilize Pittsburgh Police as a resource. We are here to help. We need to do this together. We need to look out for one another and take care of one another. Only then will we begin to heal the deep trauma that is at the root of violence. PITTSBURGH, PA (April 22, 2022)—Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire held a promotions ceremony in Council Chambers this morning.

Congratulations to all! PITTSBURGH, PA (May 11, 2022) – The City of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is offering its 2021 Annual Report for the public to review. The Bureau takes pride in its accomplishments, constantly striving for improvement and innovation. The Annual Report is an opportunity to share with the City of Pittsburgh a comprehensive overview of the work performed by the Bureau’s zone officers and specialty units, as well as a detailed statistical analysis of everything from calls for service and homicide analysis, to arrests and disciplinary action. However, this report is more than graphs, tables, and numbers. It represents people and communities who deserve safe and secure streets and homes. The report also highlights the ongoing community engagement efforts by all of our officers in order to build trust and relationships in the neighborhoods in which we serve. “Appointed with this valuable statistical information, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police strives to move through 2022 with a renewed and conscious commitment to continue building on our successes but, more importantly, learning from and improving in the areas that are calling out for more attention and care,” said Police Chief Scott Schubert. “The PBP Annual Report is a reflection of our commitment to transparency and our Crime Analysis Unit works meticulously throughout the year to provide the most comprehensive report of its kind in Western Pennsylvania,” says Commander Eric Holmes, head of the Crime Analysis Unit. Please find the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police 2021 Annual Report here: https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/18173_2021_Annual_Report_Final.pdf (PITTSBURGH, PA), May 27, 2022 – After 29 years with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, Chief Scott Schubert is announcing his retirement from the force. “Following deep reflection and significant discussion with my family, I have come to the decision that it is time to step away from the Chief’s position and allow one of my brothers or sisters in blue the opportunity to serve this great city and this storied institution. There has been no greater professional or personal joy than to have represented the City of Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police,\" said Schubert. Over his nearly three decades in public service, he rose through the ranks from Patrolman to Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Commander, Assistant Chief, and Acting Chief before being promoted to Chief of Police in February 2017. \"Being a police officer is truly the only profession I have ever wanted to pursue, but not just any police officer. From the time I was a young child I knew that I only ever wanted to be a Pittsburgh Police officer. I watched my father wear this iconic badge and patch each and every day and I knew I would follow in his footsteps. I have never regretted that decision for one moment. To serve alongside such dedicated and professional officers who continuously put their lives on the line for total strangers will always leave me awestruck. To put on this uniform every morning still fills me with such intense pride, but it's been the opportunity to work with our officers and the community to create a more equitable, safe, and inclusive City of Pittsburgh that has been my greatest passion and motivating force as Chief,” he added. During his tenure, Schubert spearheaded the implementation of the pillars of former President Obama's Task Force Report on 21st Century Policing, the most important of which is to build trust and legitimacy in the community. By establishing a Pittsburgh Police Community Engagement Office, Community Resource and Neighborhood Resource officers created and participated in a number of community engagement-related activities in schools, churches, and neighborhoods that helped build and foster positive relationships between officers and the people they serve. Schubert created partnerships with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Pirates and Penguins to build relationships with inner-city children and youth. These partnerships have impacted hundreds of lives and continue to expand each year. Chief Schubert is extremely proud of his work and relationships with Special Olympics, 412 Boxing, The Hear Foundation, and OneCOP (One Congregation, One Precinct), to name a few initiatives. Back in 2016, when he was serving as Acting Chief of Police, the Bureau received a Community Policing Commendation from the U.S. Justice Department for its innovative community outreach efforts in Pittsburgh. \"My goal has always been to continue implementing the tenets of President Obama's Report on 21st Century Policing, building and improving on those principles year after year. One of the programs I'm most proud of, which has grown out of the National Initiative, is the creation of Group Violence Intervention (GVI). GVI is a partnership between law enforcement, social services and the faith community to mediate and interrupt violence to keep it from spreading. The Bureau has wholly embraced GVI for its emphasis on preventing crime. As the entire country has fallen victim to increased violence over the past two years, I'm confident that the PBP's GVI approach will continue to be the most successful and holistic answer to reducing violence in the long term,\" said Schubert. Among the many accomplishments during his time as Chief of Police, Schubert led efforts to: - create a Real Time Crime Center (RTCC) to promote increased safety by utilizing crime-solving technology - fully adopt the use of Body Worn Cameras for all officers in a concerted effort to increase transparency and accountability - establish the Office of Strategy, Accountability, and Resiliency (OSAR) responsible for incubating, fostering, and implementing Pittsburgh Police initiatives; advancing the strategic mission of the Chief of Police by supporting short-, mid- and long-term goals, while continuously auditing established protocols and procedures to promote economy, efficiency, diversity, accountability and accreditation in the face of external challenges, and adhering to best practices in policy and procedural review and development. - partner with the US Attorney’s Office - Western PA District, to establish a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) unit within the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. This multijurisdictional unit allowed the PBP to redeploy its focus from street impact, to strategic investigations that identify and disrupt drug trafficking and gun violence at the highest levels. - establish a Civil Affairs Unit to ensure well-trained, experienced and compassionalt police officers serving as liaisons with activists and other stakeholders before, during and after first amendment-protected activities to increase communication, situational awareness and community trust. - make all Pittsburgh Police policies and procedures readily available on the City of Pittsburgh website - publish an extensive Annual Report with detailed crime statistics, arrest information and a demographic breakdown of the Bureau of Police to create one of the most comprehensive annual police reports of its kind in Western Pennsylvania - strengthen ties and increase information-sharing/cooperation with both federal and local law enforcement partners. - enter into an agreement with the Allegheny County Police Department to ensure an independent law enforcement agency investigate all Pittsburgh Police officer-involved shootings and in-custody deaths. He is also a long-standing member of the Major Cities Chiefs Association and the national ATF Crime Gun Intelligence Governance Board. Schubert's final day as Police Chief is Friday, July 1, 2022. Deputy Chief Tom Stangrecki will serve as Acting Chief until a new Chief is named. Schubert is looking forward to new opportunities to merge his public safety skills with his passion for working with the community. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and the City of Pittsburgh thank him for his tireless and dedicated service to keeping residents safe, creating numerous community partnerships, and documenting the beauty of his beloved city of Pittsburgh through his photography along the way.

Seven people, including one of our own officers, were struck by gunfire. Thankfully no one was killed and we are keeping all of the victims in our thoughts as they recover. \"I'm both saddened and angry that we as a Bureau were reminded last night of the inherent risks of the profession as officers work to take violent individuals off the streets. We are grateful that our officer is out of the hospital and doing well following this traumatic experience. There is no question that his ballistic vest saved his life. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police and its peer support team will ensure that he and his family receive all of the assistance they require. These incidents underscore the urgency we all feel to continue addressing the underlying causes of this increased violence. In the meantime, our officers will not waver in their commitment to keep Pittsburgh's communities safe and peaceful, answering 9-1-1 calls without hesitation,\" said Police Chief Scott Schubert. PITTSBURGH, PA (July 1, 2022) - The City of Pittsburgh will host its 2022 Independence Day Celebration and Fireworks on Monday, July 4. There will be multiple festivities for families to enjoy from 4-10 p.m. in Point State Park ahead of the main attraction, the Independence Day Fireworks display presented by Zambelli. The event is a huge summer draw in the City and large crowds are expected to fill Downtown, Mount Washington, the West End Overlook, and the North Shore. “The Department of Public Safety is looking forward to residents and visitors being able to gather together to celebrate Independence Day and watch the fireworks light up the skies over our beautiful city. In preparation, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, Allegheny County Police, Pennsylvania State Police, Port Authority Police, GVI, and Street Outreach are working closely together along with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire, Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS, and the Office of Emergency Management and Homeland Security, to provide a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone,” said Public Safety Director, Lee Schmidt. More than a dozen light towers will be in place to provide an added level of security at key intersections and heavily- travelled downtown corridors to help illuminate the way for pedestrians. To provide a safety perimeter during the fireworks, Point State Park wharves will be closed to boat mooring on the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers, but will be allowed on the North Shore. Drivers should be mindful of a number of road closures downtown to accommodate the crowds. These will be clearly marked. Point State Park rangers will be conducting light bag screenings at the park's entrances. For a detailed list of prohibited items, visit http://www.pittsburghpa.gov/july4/ It is important to note that at 9:30 p.m., Point State Park will be closed to additional guests who haven't made it into the park before the fireworks are set to begin at 9:35. Pittsburgh Police encourage everyone to take advantage of public transit or ride-sharing options to avoid traffic congestion downtown after the fireworks conclude at 10 p.m. Police are working closely with Pittsburgh Regional Transit (formerly Port Authority) personnel to move people out of the downtown core as quickly as possible to prevent overcrowding at the end of the evening. Transit riders should consult schedules, as some bus and rail routes do not operate, or service ends early, on holidays. Schedules can be found here: https://www.portauthority.org/all-schedules/ The Public Safety Director would also like to remind people of the dangers that consumer grade fireworks pose. “We all know Pittsburghers love their fireworks and while sales of consumer fireworks are legal, they remain a fire hazard and a safety concern. It is important to remember that fireworks are prohibited in Point State Park or any City park. In addition, the use of any fireworks, even those that are legal, is prohibited within 150 feet of any occupied structure,” said Schmidt. The City’s Fireworks Task Force enforcement initiative that began on June 27 will be in place each night until July 6 to respond to fireworks-related calls and complaints. The Fireworks Task Force is comprised of members from the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire and the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. And please do not forget about the welfare of your pets over the holiday weekend. Some pets can be extremely sensitive to the loud noises and flashing lights caused by fireworks, prompting them to run away or hide. Finally, temperatures are expected to reach highs in the 90s, with little to no precipitation in the forecast. With that in mind, it is important to remain hydrated with the right liquids and seek shelter from the heat and humidity throughout the day if you plan to spend several hours outside. Pittsburgh Public Safety is always here if you need us and we wish you a happy and safe Independence Day weekend! PITTSBURGH, PA, (July 1, 2022) -- \"Today is a day of enormous gratitude for having had the opportunity to spend nearly 30 years living my dream and doing the job I love as a member of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. Never could I have imagined on day one after graduating from the Academy, that I would go from working alongside my brothers and sisters on the streets in Zone 5, to rising through the ranks as a supervisor, to eventually being sworn in as Chief of Police in 2017. The experiences I've had while on the force have shaped me for life. There are people and calls I will never forget. This is not an ordinary job. Every day police officers work closely with people who are often experiencing one of the worst days of their lives. We must always be there for them without fail and without question. Working for - and with - the community is one of the things I will miss the most. To my brothers and sisters in the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, I pray that you stay safe, lean on your extensive training, and continue to proudly wear our iconic badge and patch. I believe in the work you do and I will always support you. I know that the vast majority of the people we serve believe in you too, and that our role in the community is as crucial as ever. To the families of our fellow officers who went to work one day and did not make it home. I have never forgotten them and their ultimate sacrifice. Their legacy of courage lives on in the Bureau each and every day. And finally, to the people of this great city, it has been my honor and privilege to serve as your Chief of Police in the City of Pittsburgh, forever my home.\" -- Scott Schubert, Pittsburgh Police Chief On July 5, 2022, Scott Schubert will begin a new position with the FBI as Section Chief overseeing the Global Law Enforcement Support Section, a section of CJIS, the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services Division in Clarksburg, West Virginia. PITTSBURGH, PA (July 13, 2022) -- It is with profound sadness that the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire announces the death today of a beloved member of its fire family. Captain Jim Ellis was a 23-year veteran of the Bureau and a respected leader at Station 32 in Deutschtown. Following an extended illness, Captain Ellis passed away at Allegheny General Hospital with his loving family and friends by his side. \"Jimmy Ellis was a 'firefighter's firefighter', a devoted family man, and the consummate professional. He was an asset not only to the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire, but to the American Fire Service, having trained firefighters both nationally and internationally. Captain Ellis was also a military veteran and he spent three years with the Wilkinsburg Fire Department before joining Pittsburgh Fire, to become a respected mentor and lifelong friend to many in the Bureau. He will be deeply missed. Rest with God Captain, we will take it from here.\" - Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire Chief, Darryl Jones. Funeral arrangements for Captain Jim Ellis will be announced at a later time. Recently, a Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Detective made false claims on several news outlets that hundreds of first responders including police, fire and EMS will face termination under the City of Pittsburgh’s Covid-19 vaccine mandate. We want to be very clear that there is no threat to Public Safety. Employees are aware that the disciplinary process is on hold while negotiations are underway with their unions. The numbers this police employee is relaying to the public are inflated and erroneous. Any further questions should be directed to the City of Pittsburgh Department of Human Resources & Civil Service. LETTER SENT JULY 1, 2022: {Employee,} Recently you received a letter from me stating that your religious accommodation request to be exempt from the City of Pittsburgh mandated COVID-19 vaccination was denied. That decision will remain. However, disciplinary action will be held in abeyance while the City of Pittsburgh is in effects bargaining. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact me at [REDACTED]. PITTSBURGH, PA (July 29, 2022) – This August, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire will host the first Girls Fire Camp in the City of Pittsburgh. PBF invites girls between 15 and 18 years old to jumpstart their career as firefighters and community leaders by learning alongside experienced women in the field. Only 20 applicants will be selected for the inaugural camp and all applicants must be residents of the City of Pittsburgh. Participants will get a well-rounded, real-life look at what it takes to become a firefighter while learning about topics that will fuel empowerment such as fitness and nutrition, emergency medical care, fire science leadership and self-confidence. “Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire recognized the need to close the gender gap that currently exists by confronting gender stereotypes and encouraging women to seek out the fire service as a viable career option. Firefighters engage with the entire community, so bringing in people of different backgrounds, genders and perspectives enhances our department's ability to better service our city,” said Fire Inspector and Fire Prevention Officer Lisa Epps-Cuda. “Our hope is that this camp’s focus on encouraging and empowering young women reflects an effort to change a profession in which women are under-represented. We aim to shift the existing trend from traditional “boys’ club” to one that is inclusive to women and minorities.” The application deadline is August 8, 2022. Applicants will be notified of acceptance by August 12. The application can be accessed here.

Medical Director Dr. Ron Roth congratulated all of the paramedics on their accomplishments, while pointing out that for the EMTs, working to advance their careers while already holding down demanding EMS jobs, is no small feat. “That was an incredible task.

As a key focus of Mayor Ed Gainey’s administration, Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt stressed the importance of ensuring that all Public Safety employees, such as those in the Bureau of EMS, are well-supported as they experience what can often be stress-filled and emotionally-challenging work days. Said Schmidt, “Make sure you’re taking care of yourself. We see people at the best moments, we can see people we serve people in their worst moments, and those things can be taken home, but we need to make sure we process those things. We have to make sure you’re keeping yourself physically fit, as well as mentally fit.” Before administering the oath of office and swearing in the new paramedics, Mayor Gainey’s Chief Operating and Administrative Officer Lisa Frank reiterated the Mayor’s vision for the City of Pittsburgh as one that is anchored in the well-being and safety of its residents. “Paramedics have a special place in the work that we do and in the work that the administration is trying to accomplish,” said Frank.

Fire Chief Daryl Jones opened the ceremony by emphasizing the officers’ connection with the community and their dedication to service. “The City and its residents rate their fire department based on performance “ said Jones. “They say we have a good fire department because the officers relate with them on the worst day of their life. They are well-prepared to take care of us and serve us, and I applaud them.” Mayor Ed Gainey administered the oath of office during the ceremony, before taking time to thank the families and expound on the work behind the promotions. “As much as I want to congratulate these gentlemen, I want to congratulate the families.

Today you can celebrate your success, but don’t let this be the last promotion.” Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt addressed the demands of leadership while operating in a first responder capacity. “This promotion is much more than a pay raise. It’s a commitment to be a leader. It’s a commitment to be accountable to yourself and to your company and to the department. It’s a commitment to create more leaders by mentoring them and showing them the way.” Anthony Horne was promoted to the rank of captain. Kirill Kuznetsov, Randolph Meyer and Jason Miller were promoted to the rank of lieutenant.

We stand with Penn Hills EMS and offer our heartfelt sympathies and ongoing support as the department mourns one of its own,\" said Pittsburgh EMS Chief Ronald Romano.

The 31 recruits, including one woman, began their 32 weeks of training on April 18. During the ceremony, IAFF Local No.1 President Ralph Sicuro told the recruits and their families that over his 25 years of service with the Bureau he has witnessed tremendous improvements to training, tactics, and the equipment that firefighters use. “To my newest brothers and sister, you have all received the best training there is to offer. You have developed the necessary skills to enter the field, but now you must hone those skills with experience,” said Sicuro. Fire Chief Darryl Jones reminded the group that on day one of their training he told them that 100% effort was not enough, and that today he was proud to say they had met that challenge. “Your sleeves are no longer slick. You now carry the symbol of excellence in the fire service on your left sleeve. You have a responsibility to support the values represented by that shield. Remember what it stands for. Remember who and what it represents. Remember those who have come before you, those who have sacrificed, those who gave all. Please don’t let them down. You are now part of something very, very special,” said Jones. Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt administered the Oath of Office and told the new firefighters that they would experience challenges and trauma on the job that would require them to take care of themselves and their colleagues. “Remember to keep yourselves physically and mentally ready. You have a whole group of people, of folks you’ve not only gone through the academy with, but now a much larger family of those who have gone through this before and have done what you're doing. If you need to talk, talk. If something is bothering you, don’t hold it in. Talk about it. They’ve been there, they’ve experienced it,” said Schmidt. Battalion Chief Michael F. Riley presented two recruits with awards earned during their eight months of training. Eric Darr received the Academic Achievement Award and James Ross earned the Physical Fitness Award. The recruits will be assigned to their respective stations to officially begin their tenure with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire on Monday, December 5. Congratulations Firefighters!

Remember to talk, don't hold it in, and love on your family as you need to.\" Mayor Gainey acknowledged the intensely difficult and emotional work that EMS personnel perform in their dedication to public service. He also honored the citizens who put the lives of a stranger in need ahead of their own and were awarded for their selflessness. \"I want to thank you because a lot of times we take these stories for granted.

Nationally, fewer than one percent of officers have the opportunity to attend the prestigious program. Internationally known for its academic excellence, the National Academy offers ten weeks of advanced communication, leadership, and fitness training. On average, officers who attend the program have 21 years of law enforcement experience and must have proven records as professionals within their agencies. In addition to her duties as a Pittsburgh Police zone supervisor, Sergeant Kearns manages the Pittsburgh Members Assistance Program (PMAP), the Bureau's peer-to-peer support program for police. During the graduation ceremony, FBI Director Christopher Wray praised Kearns for creating the program following the tragic death of FBI Special Agent Sam Hicks. Hicks was shot and killed during the takedown of a violent drug trafficking organization while Kearns was working with him as part of an FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force near Pittsburgh in 2008. “That event stuck with Carla and as she went through the grieving process, Carla realized there weren’t enough resources in place for officers struggling to process trauma from their jobs so Carla took the initiative to build a peer support program to help other officers who went through similar experiences to make sure they had the support and tools they needed to be well,” said Director Wray. The 284th session of the FBI National Academy consisted of 237 law enforcement officers from 49 states and the District of Columbia, as well as from 25 countries, five military organizations, and five federal civilian organizations. A total of 53,908 graduates have completed the FBI National Academy since it began in 1935. The FBI National Academy is held in the same facility where the FBI trains its new special agents and intelligence analysts. Congratulations Sergeant Kearns!

PITTSBURGH, PA (January 25, 2023) – New in 2023, the City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety announces the creation of the Office of Film & Event Management (OFEM). The office operates under the umbrella of the Public Safety Administration. OFEM is tasked with receiving and vetting applications for small and large-scale events and film productions occurring within the City of Pittsburgh. It is responsible for consulting with both film and event permit applicants to ensure that industry standards, safety regulations, and city policies are followed and met, as well as working with all City departments to ensure proper planning, coordination, and execution of events and film projects. Additionally, it will ensure that events and film productions do not negatively impact the City’s operations and remain positive assets to the City and its residents. Lastly, this office chairs the Special Events Committee and assists in the safe and effective planning of large scale City-owned events. Block Party permits will also be handled by this office. Prior to OFEM, film & event permitting and oversight was part of the Office of Special Events (OSE). The Office of Special Events is reinstated to the Department of Parks & Recreation (Citiparks) in 2023. Originally part of Citiparks until 2017, the OSE returns to Citiparks after six years in Public Safety Administration. OSE will continue to produce free and low cost events including community 5K races, the Community Festival Grant Program, Dollar Bank Cinema in the Park, various summer concerts, and others. Brian Katze, formerly Special Events Manager with the Office of Special Events, will lead the new office as Film & Events Manager, alongside Anna Boekenhauer as Film & Event Permit Coordinator. Film and event permit applications can be found on OFEM’s new city webpage at www.pittsburghpa.gov/publicsafety/ofem. The office may be reached by email at ofem@pittsburghpa.gov. Media inquires should be sent to pio@pittsburghpa.gov. All inquiries can be sent to ofem@pittsburghpa.gov. Our hearts are with the family and community of Tyre Nichols as they grieve their son, friend, brother and father; lost to senseless violence at the hands of those sworn to protect and serve. What happened on January 7 was a violent, inexcusable failure by the officers involved. The swift action of Tennessee law enforcement to investigate and charge those officers makes a strong statement, and sets an important precedent for the future of police accountability. Additionally, we would like to thank all those who have gathered, and continue to gather, for exercising their right to protest peacefully. Following the release of Friday's video, many have inquired whether Pittsburgh Bureau of Police has a unit similar to the Memphis \"SCORPION Unit\" that was involved in the death of Tyre Nichols and has since been deactivated. The PBP does not have a street unit like SCORPION, which operated in a capacity to target \"hotspot\" areas. Such a unit will not have a place in the policies or philosophy of Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. We continue our commitment to ensure fair, community-based policing, based in transparency and dignity for those we serve.

Fire Chief Darryl Jones opened the ceremony by praising the specialized training and mastery required to advance within the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire. “They are going out there dealing with people’s problems; meeting some of them on the first, worst, or maybe even last days of their lives. They are highly trained, highly motivated, highly rated. People are expecting the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire to take a leadership role in some of these risks and challenges we face today. And we are always up to the challenge.” Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt spoke directly to promotees about the responsibility that comes with leadership. “This promotion is much more than pay raises. It’s a commitment to be a leader. It’s a commitment to be accountable. It’s a commitment to create more leaders. As new leaders, it’s your job to build on the great things from the leaders that came before you, and start new things for the future of the Bureau.” Mayor Ed Gainey administered the Oath of Office, after speaking about the work of firefighters beyond emergency response and management. “It’s how you show up in these neighborhoods. Every community I’ve been to, no matter where it’s at, one thing I’m sure of – fire is going to be there. When kids play on the fire trucks and ask questions, that’s meaningful, because that’s community service.” Mathew Davis was sworn-in as Assistant Chief. Timothy Leech and Robert Weihaus were promoted to the rank of captain. Nicholas Leskowak, Stephanos Lignos and Garrett Walz were promoted to the rank of lieutenant.

Second Avenue Parking Plaza PITTSBURGH, PA (March 10 , 2023) – Pittsburgh Bureau of Emergency Medical Services held a swearing-in ceremony Friday for two paramedics.The ceremony was held in the Mayor’s Conference Room. The two paramedics recently completed their 180-day probationary period and will now begin their advancement through the ranks of EMS. Alex Cappellini and Adam Croci were both sworn-in as paramedics. EMS Chief Ronald Romano reminded the two promotees that they are part of an important tradition in the city. \"This is the 48th year of working in Pittsburgh, not far off from 50 years. You are now the continuation of that 48 years. It's up to you to keep us moving forward and keep us on the cutting edge of what we do everyday, and I know you're up for the task.\" Associate Medical Director Dr. Lennie Weiss spoke about emerging from the most challenging time in the history of prehospital care, as challenges seem amplified in the wake of the pandemic. “Now more than ever, we need you. You provide access to emergency care to those who struggle. You support people with mental health needs; you care for victims of illness and injury during the scariest minutes of their lives.You are the patient advocate. As an EMS professional, you are a vital asset to our nation and our city.\" Director Schmidt reminded the new paramedics that Pittsburgh EMS grew out of the creation of Freedom House in 1967, where first responders developed new and innovative protocols for prehospital care. “Remember, as you are now part of this team, that you are also part of building new futures for EMS; not just here in Pittsburgh, because what we do in Pittsburgh spreads around the world.\" Before administering the oath of office, Mayor Ed Gainey recognized the paramedics' families and reminded them of the important role they would play as they serve the city. \"There are going to be things they see on the job that when they come home, they're going to need ten minutes just to decompress. They're going to need that love and support.\" Mayor Gainey gave the two a chance to talk about why EMS is important to them. The paramedics spoke of their desire to help people in the community who may not have the means or access to mainstream healthcare, their love of the city, and the work of EMS as a calling. PITTSBURGH, PA (March, 14, 2023) -- Pittsburgh EMS and the Office of Community Health & Safety (OCH&S) are proud to announce the implementation of a Community Paramedicine Program in Pittsburgh. As the birthplace of both modern paramedicine and the field of community paramedicine, this is the evolution and advancement of a long-standing tradition of public health-driven care in the city. Under the direction of EMS Community Paramedic Crew Chief John Mooney and OCH&S Manager Laura Drogowski, the program will be designed to address the needs of the most vulnerable in our community. An alarming number of people in Pittsburgh are living with untreated conditions - and dying - because they do not have access to resources to manage their chronic health needs. Even when services and support systems are available, they are unable to reach them and calling 9-1-1 can become their only lifeline. \"The City, through Community Paramedicine, has a unique opportunity to truly \"see\" these residents. Ongoing support by EMS Community Paramedics and OCH&S social workers will help connect patients with the proper health services, allowing them to remain stable in their own homes and avoid future hospitalization. This reduces their reliance on the 9-1-1 system and improves patient outcomes,\" said EMS Assistant Chief, Mark Pinchalk. Prior to the program's official launch, Crew Chief Mooney and EMS personnel have been working closely with OCH&S social workers since late 2021 to provide care to patients outside of 9-1-1 calls. \"Paramedics and EMTs most often see these patients on an emergency call basis, unable to help them long-term with their treatable conditions. It's devastating for first responders to regularly witness patients decline in health over multiple visits. With this dedicated, full-time program, we will be able to provide ongoing support for patients, in collaboration with other Department of Public Safety bureaus, community partners, and health systems,\" said Community Paramedic John Mooney. Many of the patients who frequently call EMS are living with difficult-to-manage chronic health conditions such as obstructive lung diseases (asthma and COPD), diabetes, seizure disorders, and heart disease. Patients with higher rates of EMS calls also use the emergency system for minor falls, mobility challenges, and mental health issues. If their needs go unaddressed, they can experience increasingly serious or catastrophic outcomes without the ability to access resources outside of calling 9-1-1. Recognizing that EMS is public health, Office of Community Health & Safety Manager Laura Drogowski helped spearhead and design the Community Paramedicine program. OCH&S community social workers, in partnership with EMS personnel, provide a continuum of care, so that residents may receive sustained, durable, health support. \"A devastating number of our residents are in desperate need of assistance, be that medical, social, psychological or systems navigation. The ability to access promised resources can often take hours on the phone, knowing exactly who to call and what to say; even then people fall through the cracks. Falling through the cracks means that people die, alone, from treatable conditions. Our first responders see them every day. We are committed to changing these outcomes, providing advocacy, connecting patients with resources, and fighting for what is needed,\" said Drogowski. Moving forward, the Community Paramedic Crew Chief will work with three EMS-OCH&S liaisons and OCH&S social workers, with intensive engagement from EMS colleagues and other Department of Public Safety bureaus to provide patient care, build program infrastructure and referral partners, and train personnel to advance and grow the program. Other public health-informed care programs between OCH&S and Public Safety bureaus are already operational, including collaborations with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire and its People In Need of Support (PINS) program, and with the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police through the Trauma Survivor Assistance Program (TSAP) and co-response unit - an ongoing pilot program operating in the North Side since February 15, 2023. EMS Community Paramedic Crew Chief John Mooney and City of Pittsburgh Community Social Worker Anmol Baxi PITTSBURGH, PA, (March 30, 2023) -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police held a promotions ceremony today in Council Chambers as four members advanced to the next stage in their law enforcement careers. Sergeant Andrew Baker was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant, while Detective Anthony Barber, Detective Gino Macioce, and Officer Sean Gavin advanced to the rank of Sergeant. Acting Chief of Police Thomas Stangrecki acknowledged that the success of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police depends on the strength of its leadership team, of which the newly promoted officers are a part. “These individuals have proven their knowledge, skills and ability to be great leaders, as evidenced through their hard work and extra duties that they have taken to achieve this promotion,” said Stangrecki. Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt addressed the promotees, reminding them they have been leaders throughout their careers, which isn't always an easy road. \"It means putting respect before popularity, which takes empathy. It means you have to care about your people more than your own discomfort - your own fear, your apprehension, and your awkwardness. You have to have the difficult conversations, you cannot be everyone's friend. True friends won't expect you to treat them differently.\" Before Mayor Ed Gainey administered the Oath of Office, he acknowledged the importance of police officers having a support system in place. “I just want to say thank you to the families that are here today. Thank you, because without love, none of them would get to this level. Without love it’s hard to grow up and advance in your career. So today, even though they are being promoted, this is also your promotion.” The promotees will complete two weeks of supervisor training at the Academy, followed by three to six weeks of field training before being assigned to their new duty locations. Congratulations to Lieutenant Baker and Sergeants Barber, Macioce, and Gavin! PITTSBURGH, PA (April 3, 2023) - After 45 years of devoted service to the City of Pittsburgh, EMS Chief Ronald Romano is retiring from the Pittsburgh Bureau of EMS. Friday, March 31, 2023 was his last day in uniform. Romano began his EMS career in 1975 with Perman Ambulance Service in Pittsburgh. In March of 1978, he was hired as a paramedic with the City of Pittsburgh. He first worked on the city's North Side at Medic 4, where he spent two years. He was promoted to Crew Chief and spent five years at Medic 3 in the West End and a little more than two years at Medic 13, which has since been taken out of service. He rose through the ranks over the years to first become a Field Supervisor, which later became the District Chief position. In February 2005, he advanced to Division Chief of the Ambulance Division, a position that also handled all EMS planning for major events in Pittsburgh. Romano became Deputy EMS Chief in March 2016 and was promoted in October 2018 as the City's 7th Chief of Pittsburgh EMS by then-Mayor, Bill Peduto. City Council honored his more than four decades of service with a proclamation, declaring March 28, 2023, Chief Ronald Romano Day in the City of Pittsburgh. During the ceremony, Chief Romano thanked his wife Lucy, his daughters Rachel and Leah, his son, Ron Jr. and his extended family for their support over the years. He reflected on the many pivotal moments he experienced during his career, but acknowledged that his most fulfilling accomplishment occurred relatively recently, following one of the most challenging periods during his tenure; the global COVID-19 pandemic. \"We did not have one employee get admitted to the hospital, let alone pass away during the pandemic. We were able to continue to support the system and put the trucks on the road every day when numerous systems across the country were shutting down. That's a compliment to all of my staff,\" said Chief Romano. He told Council Members and those who gathered for the ceremony, that they may not have known it, but he worried about his EMS personnel every day, from the moment he went to sleep, from the moment he woke up. Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt worked with Chief Romano in recent years and during his own career in the EMS field, prior to joining the City of Pittsburgh. \"He was always the consummate professional who put his staff and their well-being first. He believed in ongoing training for EMTs and paramedics and investing in technology to ensure that Pittsburgh EMS remains one of the most respected pre-hospital care services in the country. His calm nature and dedication to the job will be greatly missed, but Chief Romano has left the Bureau of EMS on solid footing and in capable hands.\" The Department of Public Safety and the City of Pittsburgh congratulate Ronald Romano on his retirement and 45 years of faithful service to the residents and visitors to Pittsburgh.

This means embracing new technologies, fostering a culture of continuous learning and promoting diversity and inclusivity within our ranks.

Congratulations Chief Scirotto! (PITTSBURGH, PA), June 14, 2023 -- The upcoming long weekend of June 16-19, 2023 promises to be another jam-packed four days of events in Pittsburgh. With Juneteenth celebrations beginning on Friday with live performances and vendors, a parade on Saturday, Juneteenth Freedom Day fireworks in Point State Park on Monday, June 19, as well as two back-to-back Taylor Swift concerts on Friday and Saturday, unprecedented numbers of people will be converging on both Downtown and the North Shore. \"The City of Pittsburgh is excited to play host to these two popular events, welcoming both residents and visitors to enjoy all that Downtown and the North Shore have to offer. The Department of Public Safety has worked hard with organizers of both events to ensure the safety of everyone involved. We ask that anyone who is participating pay close attention to the planned security measures to ensure things run smoothly,\" said Public Safety Director, Lee Schmidt.

In other cities, as many as 100 thousand Taylor Swift fans, both with tickets and without, have gathered around the venue areas to be a part of the experience. Acrisure Stadium is strongly discouraging all non-ticket holders to avoid coming down to the stadium and the North Shore, as both will be at maximum capacity. Additional foot and vehicle traffic will only create gridlock and slow down the entrance and exit process at the venue. Both the Department of Public Safety and Acrisure Stadium highly encourage concert attendees to use public transit such as https://www.rideprt.org/ buses and light rail, ride share platforms, or alternate means of transportation such as the Gateway Clipper to reach the North Shore.

River Rescue will be patrolling the rivers, as many people are expected to take in the events from the River Walk and from boats on the water. \"The Department of Public Safety is asking everyone to do their part and plan their trip ahead of time. This will help law enforcement and all Public Safety personnel protect Juneteenth attendees and concert-goers this weekend.

(PITTSBURGH, PA) -- June 16, 2023 -- \"October 27, 2018 will forever be remembered as one of the darkest days in the City of Pittsburgh. Eleven lives were taken in a horrific act of hate in a place that should have been a sanctuary of peace for members of the three congregations worshipping inside the Tree of Life synagogue. Today, the jury of seven women and five men found the defendant, Robert Bowers, guilty on all 63 federal charges against him. City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety personnel who responded to the tragedy have been indelibly marked by what they experienced that day. The trial has inevitably ripped open wounds that may never truly heal. It is the Department of Public Safety's fervent hope that the verdict brings the victims’ families, and our personnel involved, a measure of justice for those whose lives were lost.\" - Lee Schmidt, Director of Public Safety (PITTSBURGH, PA), June 22, 2023 --The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police family is deeply saddened to announce the passing of a beloved colleague and friend. On Wednesday, June 21, 2023, Sergeant Dawn Mercurio, age 53, passed away peacefully while surrounded by her loving family, who provided the following statement: \"Sergeant Mercurio fell ill in September of 2020, after being diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma, a rare form of kidney cancer. This left her unable to continue her service to our great Pittsburgh communities. Dawn served honorably, respectfully, and with great empathy toward those in need. Her policing career began in 2007, after she decided to leave the teaching field. After completing the police academy at age 37, Dawn’s first assignment was at the Zone 2 police station. Here she worked as a uniformed patrol officer before being selected for a plainclothes detective position. Detective Mercurio then transferred to the Zone 6 police station where she continued to work as a plainclothes detective before earning a promotion to sergeant early in 2018. She remained assigned to Zone 6 before her illness forced her into early retirement at the end of 2021. In addition to her supervisor duties, Sergeant Mercurio was an adjunct instructor at the Pittsburgh Police Training Academy. Sergeant Mercurio also worked closely with Pittsburgh SWAT as a negotiator. This gave her the opportunity to work alongside her husband, Sergeant Larry Mercurio, who is a long time member of Pittsburgh SWAT. His additional duties include supervising the Calvin Hall Public Safety Center located in the Northview Heights section of Zone 1. Dawn and Larry both grew up in Sheraden, located in the West End of Pittsburgh. Their fairytale relationship began at age 12 for Dawn and age 13 for Larry. They have never left each other’s side since. The couple married on Sept 19th, 1995, although Larry argues their true anniversary date is February 14th, 1983. This was the day they made their relationship official at the Langley H.S. Valentine’s Day dance. Larry asked Dawn if she would “go with him,” and off they went forever together, as one. Dawn and Larry raised three amazing children together. Dawn loved them with everything in her. She was deeply faithful and the Lord gave Dawn the most beautiful gift imaginable when both of their daughters, Taylor and Alexis, gave birth to Dawn and Larry’s two grandsons within two days of each other. Colton and Ryder were born January 22 and January 24, 2023. Sergeant Mercurio spent her last months of life with a smile ear to ear, playing with her grandbabies and spending precious time with her loving husband and children. While Dawn will be incredibly missed, we know for a fact she is in heaven worshiping Jesus face to face.\" - The Mercurio Family “He will wipe every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death or sorrow or crying or pain.

Information for the Police Data Portal is collected from the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police (PBP) records management system which stores all records of reportedcriminal activity. The timeframe for the data is year-to-date for 2023 and will be manually updated on a monthly basis between the first and fifth to reflect the preceding month. As the Bureau transitions to the new Records Management System (RMS), it aims to establish as close to a real-time data feed as possible, which would allow for more frequent or automatic updates to the information. “By making comprehensive crime data publicly available and easily accessible, residents are better informed about their own neighborhoods, the city as a whole, and the work of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. As Chief, I am committed to driving accountability through transparency and the Police Data Portal is another building block toward that goal,” said Pittsburgh Police Chief, Larry Scirotto. The data portal allows users to filter the information by police zone, neighborhood, crime type, and date. All of the information is provided at the incident level. Violent crimes of a sexual nature have been excluded from the data set that populates the dashboard. In addition, no personally identifying information is attached to the incidents and all locations have been masked to the block-level, meaning that no specific addresses are made public. It should be noted that the data included in this portal is gathered from police reports. A police report is a formal document detailing circumstances of a criminal incident that has been brought to the attention of law enforcement. Police reports are not the same as \"call for service\" records. While reports may be filed as a result of a call for service, not all calls result in a police report.

For over 21 years, Dr. Roth served as the Medical Director for the department, bridging academics, public health, and public safety. \"It is a great honor to have worked closely with Dr. Roth during his long tenure with the City of Pittsburgh. We in Public Safety will miss the privilege of having his extensive medical knowledge readily accessible to us to help create guidelines for our bureaus and protect the city,” said Public Safety Director, Lee Schmidt. Dr. Roth was born in Pittsburgh to parents Lawrence and Eleanor Roth. He completed EMT training in 1977 at Penn State University, thus beginning his EMS career. In 1982 he earned his medical degree from the University of Pittsburgh, where he went on to complete his residency in Emergency Medicine. During residency, Dr. Roth staffed a 24/7 physician emergency response vehicle and served as a flight physician on a medical helicopter. He has worked at the UPMC Presbyterian Emergency Department for over 30 years. Dr. Roth is board certified in Emergency Medicine and was one of the first physicians board certified in the subspecialty of Emergency Medical Services. “At no time was Dr. Roth’s expertise more evident and more valuable than during the Covid-19 pandemic. Dr. Roth's ability to stay abreast of the very latest national guidelines and best practices to calmly guide the City of Pittsburgh through the worst of the crisis, helped to protect employees, residents, and visitors,” added Director Schmidt. Pittsburgh is home to a unique Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system where physicians work side-by-side with paramedics and Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs); both in the field on emergency calls, but also during expansive training and medical protocol development efforts. “The Bureau of Emergency Medical Services is dedicated to saving the lives of Pittsburgh’s residents and visitors though prehospital care. It is because of the special relationship that exists between our experienced EMS providers and the hospital community, fostered by Dr. Roth, that we are so successful in the work we do,” said Pittsburgh Chief of EMS, Amera Gilchrist. “We honor Dr. Roth and his many years of impassioned service. He has truly left an indelible mark on the work we do every day. And we can take comfort in knowing that Dr. Roth has prepared his successor, Dr. Lenny Weiss, as the next Medical Director and that the City of Pittsburgh remains in very capable hands.” In his career, Dr. Roth served as medical director of paramedic training at the Center for Emergency Medicine, Director of the UPMC EMS fellowship, and Chief of the Division of EMS in the Department of Emergency Medicine. Currently, he serves as a Medical Command Physician at the UPMC Medical Command Center, and as medical director for the Pittsburgh Marathon and the Allegheny County Emergency Operations Center. Additionally, he is a team physician for the Pittsburgh Steelers football club “Citizens and healthcare professionals alike are fortunate to reside in Pittsburgh, the founding place of EMS in our country, because of outstanding local programs like Freedom House and the Center for Emergency Medicine. Dr. Roth has expanded that heritage during a tenure of over 30 dedicated years and carved a future to continue partnerships with the strongest emergency medical service and public safety program in the nation. I am proud to continue his legacy,” said Dr. Lenny Weiss, incoming City of Pittsburgh Medical Director. The entire Department of Public Safety thanks Dr. Roth for his selfless service to the city and wishes him a happy and well-deserved retirement. PITTSBURGH, PA, (October 12, 2023) -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire held a promotions ceremony in Council Chambers as fourteen members of the department advanced to the next stage in their careers. Eight firefighters were promoted to the position of lieutenant, five lieutenants became captains, and one captain was promoted to the rank of battalion chief. With family, friends and fellow firefighters gathered, Fire Chief Darryl Jones spoke directly to the newly-promoted Lieutenants and Captains, reminding them that they are company officers who are the bridge between the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire and the public who calls when they need them the most; in the midst of emergencies. \"Your job is to interact with these people with compassion, with courtesy, with respect, and most of all, with expertise to be able to handle their problem and bring it to a successful conclusion. They have a right, indeed they have the expectation, that when that rig pulls up in front of their house, the people who get off of it are qualified to handle the situation,\" said Chief Jones. The Chief also addressed his new battalion chief about the responsibilities behind the extra bugles on his collar. \"You are making a step above being a line officer and moving into a true leadership position. Leadership is a hard position. It takes a strong constitution. It takes moral thinking and hard ethics. Everybody wants to talk about the moral decision. A moral decision is not a decision between what's right and what's wrong. A moral decision is between what's right and what's right....so I'm imploring you, challenging you this day, to be strong, to represent the patch that's on your shoulder to be not perfect, but at least excellent.\" Before administering the Oath of Office, Mayor Ed Gainey acknowledged the families of the newly-promoted personnel. \"I want to say thank you. I understand that no one makes it on this journey without a strong family. I believe that. I believe that the family and the pouring of love into the ones who will be recognized today is why we stand here today. Without family it could not be done, so I personally want to thank every family member in here today for the sacrifice and dedication you made to your loved ones for them to stand here today and be promoted,\" said Mayor Gainey.

They are the ones who are responsible for ensuring our streets are safe, our communities are secure, and our citizens can rest easy at night. The commanders and sergeants have not only met, but exceeded the high standards we hope for leadership within the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. They have demonstrated their unwavering dedication to the mission of public service, their tireless efforts to foster positive community relations, and their commitment to the values and integrity of justice,\" said Chief Scirotto. Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt spoke directly to the sergeants and commanders about the expanded responsibilities their new roles entail. \"When you work with your officers, listen to them, make sure you are supporting them with what they need - not just what they want - but what they need. Sometimes they need someone not to be their friend, but to be their boss...to be there to show them the way,\" said Director Schmidt. Before the Honorable Mayor Ed Gainey administered the Oath of Office, he acknowledged that with these promotions, the new commanders and supervisors have reached heights in their careers that not every police officer achieves. Congratulations to all of the newly-promoted commanders and sergeants!

You provide access to emergency care to those who struggle, support people with mental health needs, treat acute and chronic problems on the streets, and tend to illness and injury during the scariest moments of our patients’ lives. You are patient advocates—on you they depend.” Chief Amera Gilchrist praised her staff for their devotion to the field of prehospital care and emphasized that the day was a celebration of hard work and perseverance. “Today is a good day for Pittsburgh EMS. You are the silent heroes who work tirelessly to save lives, often in the most challenging and difficult circumstances.

Your promotion is a testament to your unwavering commitment to excellence in the face of adversity,” said Director Schmidt. Before the Honorable Mayor Ed Gainey administered the Oath of Office, he acknowledged that these promotions would not be possible without the support of each crew members’ family and emphasized that each promotee had recognized the call to embrace greater responsibility and excellence. A hearty congratulations to all those who were sworn-in and promoted in the Bureau of Emergency Medical Services! PITTSBURGH — With the recently announced official Halloween Trick or Treat hours, the Office of Film and Event Management would like to remind residents that they can apply for a block party permit to extend their holiday festivities. Typically, block party permits can only be issued on weekends or federal holidays, but Halloween is the exception—in an effort to make our local streets the safest possible environment for Pittsburgh’s kids as they trick or treat. Halloween block party permits are valid from 5:00 p.m. – 8:00 p.m. The applications must still meet the rest of the block party permit requirements: Churches and other houses of worship are also eligible to apply for block party permits, so long as they are located on the street being requested and the rest of the conditions are met. The fee for these permits is $25 and the application must be submitted by 5:00 p.m. on Monday, October 23, to be accepted. The application can be found at: https://pittsburghpa.gov/publicsafety/ofem-eventpermits. All questions regarding block party permits can be directed to the Office of Film & Event Management at: ofem@pittsburghpa.gov. ### PITTSBURGH, PA, (November 14, 2023) -- Beginning today, in accordance with the national shift in crime data collection and reporting methods, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police will switch over to the National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS). NIBRS is the law enforcement community's standard for quantifying crime, replacing the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) method which was formally discontinued on January 1, 2021. With this changeover, the public should be aware that there are important differences between the two reporting methods that result in crime statistics that initially appear to be higher than usual, due to the specificity of the information gathered using the NIBRS system. Here are some of the key differences between the two reporting methods: Changes in offenses - Both NIBRS and UCR collect data on \"crimes against persons\" and \"crimes against property\" for such offenses as homicide, aggravated assault, rape, robbery, burglary, arson, auto theft, and others. But unlike UCR, NIBRS also documents the additional category of \"crimes against society\" which do not actually involve an injured party or piece of property. These would include prohibitions against certain types of activity such as drugs, gambling, pornography, prostitution, and weapons law violations. NIBRS also documents offenses such as animal cruelty, extortion, and identity theft. Seriousness of offenses - NIBRS tends to show higher figures than UCR due to the manner in which offenses are counted. UCR data recognizes the most serious offense committed during an incident, whereas NIBRS essentially eliminates the \"hierarchy\" of offenses, as officers can collect data on up to 10 criminal offenses within an incident. For example, using the old UCR system, in a reported incident where a homicide occurs, but the actor also breaks into the home, vandalizes it, and then steals a vehicle to leave the crime scene, only the most serious offense of homicide would be reported. Using NIBRS, every offense would be included in one report, provided the offenses are separate and distinct crimes and each are mutually exclusive crimes. Changes in crime classification - Under the old UCR system, offenses are categorized as Part I - serious crimes against persons and property - and Part II - all other non-miscellaneous offenses. These will be replaced by Group A and Group B offenses under NIBRS. Group A is comprised of more than 20 indexed crime categories, as opposed to the eight indexed offenses in the UCR. Officers will have to determine which category an offense belongs to in order to determine whether an arrest report or an incident report will be required. Under UCR, attempted crimes are reported as crime. The new NIBRS system focuses on whether the crime was attempted or completed. NIBRS does not allow duplicate offenses based on incident-based reporting (IBR) codes. For example, possession of cocaine and possession of heroin would qualify as one drug offense, not two. As mentioned previously, officers may report multiple offenses, provided they are separate and distinct crimes, each mutually exclusive. Pittsburgh Police Acting Commander of Administration, Patrick Fosnaught, headed up the team that has been working since 2021 to build out the new records management and reporting system. \"With a great deal of assistance from our partners in Allegheny County, as well as help from other police agencies that are currently using the system, the team has worked to meet the more specific needs of the Pittsburgh Police through data input, design, and focused outputs. The new system will provide better data collection, upgraded functionality, improved performance, and enhanced search and investigative capabilities. All of these will allow officers to focus on police-related tasks, rather than spending valuable time on data entry and outdated processes,\" says Acting Commander Fosnaught. It should be noted that each law enforcement agency's NIBRS system is tailored to the individual state's specifications. Data compiled by Pittsburgh Police, and ultimately reported to the FBI, is in accordance with guidelines required by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. ### Source - CentralSquare PITTSBURGH — The Department of Public Safety is gearing up for the much-anticipated 62nd Annual Highmark Light Up Night festivities on Saturday, November 18.

PITTSBURGH, PA, (December 12, 2023) -- It is with deep sadness that the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police acknowledges the death of Therese Rocco at age 97. Rocco began at age 19 as a clerk in the Bureau's then all-female Missing Persons Unit, before becoming an officer in 1952. Also known as \"The Rock,\" her storied law enforcement career spanned more than 40 years. She rose through the ranks to become a Captain, then a Commander in 1986, before being promoted in 1989 to Assistant Chief of Police, the first woman in the department, and the country, to reach such a high-ranking position. She also became a nationally renowned expert in the field of missing persons, particularly children. Rocco grew up in the Hill District and later lived in Brookline, retiring in 1994. \"With her courage and tenaciousness, Therese Rocco blazed a trail not only for women, but for all those who may have once believed a career in law enforcement was out of reach for them. We owe her a debt of gratitude for helping lead the way,\" said Police Chief, Larry Scirotto. In June of this year, Therese Rocco visited for the first time the room that is named for her at Pittsburgh Police Headquarters; the Therese Rocco Media Room. She spoke with the assistant chiefs who gathered to greet her at that time about the challenges she faced as a woman in law enforcement. She also acknowledged the case of Mary Ann Verdecchia, a 10-year-old girl who disappeared in 1962 from Bloomfield and was never found. Rocco was the lead investigator and said the unsolved case still troubled her. The Bureau's thoughts are with Therese Rocco's family, friends, and former colleagues during this difficult time. On Monday, December 18, Frank F. DeBor Funeral Home located at 1065 Brookline Blvd. will hold a viewing and prayer service from 09:30-10:30 a.m. Pittsburgh Police will provide ceremonial honors during this time. A funeral mass will follow at St.Teresa of Kolkata Parish, St. Pius X Church located at 3040 Pioneer Avenue. Mass will begin at 11:00 a.m. PITTSBURGH, PA, (December 29, 2023) -- Following months of planning, the Department of Public Safety is ready to celebrate Highmark First Night 2024 in the city with a full complement of first responders to keep everyone safe. \"The annual First Night event is an opportunity to experience and take advantage of Pittsburgh's vibrant Downtown core, with multiple venues and activities for everyone to enjoy.

Our officers will be highly visible throughout the evening and available to assist when needed. Please do not hesitate to ask for help or report any suspicious or criminal activity,\" said Pittsburgh Police Chief Larry Scirotto. The weather is expected to be seasonal with temperatures forecast in the low to mid-30s with a chance of precipitation. Pittsburgh Police and their law enforcement partners will be actively watching for impaired drivers and encourage everyone to plan a safe ride home either from a designated driver, hiring a ride-share service such as Uber or Lyft, or by taking advantage of public transit. Pittsburgh Regional Transit buses and rail service will operate on holiday schedules on January 1, 2024 and on Sunday schedules with detours Downtown on December 31. https://www.rideprt.org/schedules/holiday-schedules/ The Department of Public Safety wishes everyone a peaceful and safe First Night celebration in the City, and a happy and prosperous New Year.

And reminded them to never lose their passion for what drove them to the firefighting career. Fire Chief Darryl Jones spoke directly to the recruit graduates and told them that despite all the training they have recently completed, they are right back at the beginning. “This is just the beginning of a career in service. Service to your community, service to your family, service to the Fire Bureau, and service to each other. The citizens and visitors of the city of Pittsburgh judge us according to the level of service we provide,” said Jones. “Keep in mind, you are meeting people on the worst day of their lives. When they are under immense stress. It is those individuals we serve. And they deserve our absolute best level of service and our deepest respect.” Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt administered the Oath of Office and swore in the members of Recruit Class 133: Evan Ban, Ryan Bickert, Corey Bogaski, Kevin Brozi, Jesse Byerly, Daniel Devinney, Jordan Diaz, Sean Dorian, Richard Fashion, Roy Grimm, Philip Jandrokovic, Christopher Kelley, Joe Kuhn, Brandon Murphy, Tyler Niedermeyer, Brian O’Leary II, Patrick Onufer, Marco Panaia, Hunter Reed, Nicholas Reiser, Robert Rotondo, Joseph Schanck, Mark Schreiner, Jr., John Scott, Matthew Skvarna, Nathan Totino, Garrett Walsh, Craig Wilson, and Tad Wissel.

PITTSBURGH, PA (January 30, 2024) -- The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police acknowledges that Mr. Todd Hollis, attorney for the family of Jim Rogers, has chosen to publicly release the body worn and dash camera footage of the Pittsburgh Police interaction with Jim Rogers on October 13, 2021, afterthe federal judge in the civil case granted permission for its release and dissemination. Police are aware that content of the video will be disturbing for many to watch and that people will want to know what we are doing to ensure that individuals in police custody are treated with care and respect. In addition to the thorough critical incident review and disciplinary action recommended for the involved officers following the death of Mr. Rogers, Pittsburgh Police have since made several policy and procedural improvements. These include: - Assigning an officer with the specific task of monitoring prisoners during transfer to the nearest hospital with an emergency room - Summoning EMS to respond every time a Taser is deployed, with medics evaluating the individual on scene - Retraining all police personnel on how to avoid single officer tactics - Training all officers on the \"duty to intervene\" - Reviewing all body worn camera after every use of force Pittsburgh Police would again like to take this opportunity to express their deepest condolences to the family and friends of Mr. Jim Rogers and to reassure the public that the Bureau and its officers are fully committed to ensuring that all individuals in Pittsburgh Police custody are afforded the highest standard of care. It is important to note that the City is prohibited from releasing investigative information due to CHRIA, the Criminal History Record and Information Act. Furthermore, the decision on whether or not to release body camera video to the public does not fall under the City's authority. The federal court issued an order pertaining to these materials under the Frierson case, GD No.: 22-523; Protective Order Amending Parties Stipulation for Confidential Litigation Materials. Please find the order attached. The Bureau of Police and the Department of Public Safety have no further comment at this time. PITTSBURGH — The Department of Public Safety Bureau of Animal Care and Control is announcing a pause in the Spay and Neuter Program. The program has historically served city residents by providing no-cost spay and neuter services for pet dogs and cats, and feral cat colonies. City of Pittsburgh tax money funds the program to ensure that the population of dogs and cats in Pittsburgh remains at sustainable levels. However, during a recent evaluation of the program, it became clear that services were being used in inappropriate ways disingenuous to the spirit of the program. Such examples of these program abuses include individuals using the city addresses of friends and family members to bring in animals from outside city limits to take advantage of the service. “The Bureau of Animal Care & Control is currently working with our partners at Humane Animal Rescue and Animal Friends to address some of the issues that have arisen with the Spay and Neuter Program as its use has grown and the associated costs have increased,” said Lee Schmidt, Director of Public Safety. The City of Pittsburgh and the Bureau of Animal Care and Control is committed to assisting those resident pet owners most in need with the cost of altering their animals as well as ensuring that the community cat population is kept under control. While the program is paused, staff will evaluate potential applicant criteria in order to develop a program adapted to those goals. “We are excited to build out a more sustainable and equitable program and are looking forward to rolling out a new and improved program to all city residents that also ensures good stewardship of tax payer dollars,” added Director Schmidt. Individuals who have already submitted an application and/or have a spay or neuter currently scheduled will be contacted by the Bureau directly. PITTSBURGH – The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police promoted thirteen of its personnel as family, friends, and colleagues gathered in City Council Chambers to witness and celebrate their achievements. Five officers were promoted to the rank of sergeant, one sergeant was promoted to lieutenant, three lieutenants and one sergeant became commanders, and three commanders were elevated to the position of assistant chief. Police Chief Larry Scirotto spoke of the qualities that informed his decision on who should be promoted to leadership roles within the Bureau. “When I looked at the list of those considered to be promoted, there is one thing that can’t be measured by arrests, by traffic stops, by other types of metrics that we use in policing…and it’s character. Each one of you possess that with the highest regard. It’s not something you’re taught, it’s not something you learn, it’s just innate. That’s why I sit here confident in these promotions. All of you possess exemplary character to represent this bureau well,” said Scirotto. Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt congratulated the newly-promoted supervisors, acknowledging that each one of them has exhibited exceptional dedication, perseverance, and a commitment to public safety. “Today we applaud your accomplishments and celebrate the milestones you have reached. A promotion is not merely a recognition of past achievements, but a call to embrace greater responsibility. As you assume your new roles, remember that leadership is not about authority and power, it is about service, compassion, and leading by example. Your actions will shape the future of our police bureau and our communities.” Before administering the Oath of Office, the Honorable Mayor Ed Gainey took a moment to acknowledge the children and families of those who were being promoted and called attention to the sacrifices they make while their loved ones are keeping the city safe. Christopher Ragland, Martin Devine, and Richard Ford were promoted to the position of Assistant Chief. William Fleske, Patrick Fosnaught, Timothy Novosel, and Larry Mercurio were promoted to the rank of Commander. Harrison Maddox was promoted to Lieutenant. Officers Alexander Royal, Patrick Eaken, Jason Farrell, Kenneth Leithner, and Joe Reiff were promoted to Sergeant. Heartfelt congratulations to everyone on their promotions! PITTSBURGH, PA -- Beginning Monday, February 26, 2024, Pittsburgh Bureau of Police personnel will transition from traditional eight-hour work days, back to four 10-hour shifts each week, with three consecutive days off. This organizational change is designed to enhance officer wellness, a key pillar in Chief Scirotto's priorities for the Bureau. \"An additional day away from work each week to focus on family, friends, or outside pursuits is key to creating a healthy workforce and contributes to the Bureau's goal of not only recruiting new officers, but retaining them for the long haul, \" said Chief Larry Scirotto. Officers will also be afforded one hour of wellness time each week while on shift to use at their discretion. In addition to the revised work schedule, the Bureau is making additional adjustments to more effectively serve Pittsburgh residents and visitors to the city. Some of the changes are as follows: \"Following thorough audits of how police resources were being allocated, these improvements are backed by data to ensure that the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is serving the city in the most efficient and responsible manner, placing the primary focus on areas of concern to enhance quality of life in our neighborhoods, improve community/police partnerships, and prioritize officer wellness. These are my key priorities for the Bureau, which will only serve to strengthen public safety in the city,\" said Scirotto. ### PITTSBURGH — The Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire held a promotions ceremony in Council Chambers as five members of the bureau advanced to the next stage in their careers. Chief of Fire Darryl Jones opened the ceremony by emphasizing the role that officers play in facilitating connection between firefighters and the community they serve. ”As company officers you are the bridge between the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire and the public. As that initial point of contact, your level of professionalism and empathy is what’s going to drive people to recognize the quality of service we provide.” Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt spoke about the responsibility that comes with leadership. “This promotion is much more than just a pay raise. It’s a commitment to be a leader. A commitment to be held accountable. And a commitment to grow and help new leaders come forward. Thank you for stepping up and committing to become new leaders in the bureau.” Before administering the Oath of Office, Mayor Ed Gainey acknowledged the families of the newly-promoted personnel. “I want to thank the families. Without your support, we would not be here to celebrate the hard work and sacrifices of these firefighters.” The ceremony also served to highlight the forty-three years of exceptional service that Maxine Anthony has given to the Bureau of Fire by honoring her with a proclamation. “We recognize Ms. Anthony, a dedicated public servant whose unwavering commitment to the City of Pittsburgh has spanned an impressive four decades. It is with great pride and gratitude that I extend this proclamation, acknowledging her remarkable career and expressing our most profound appreciation for her invaluable contributions to the community,” said Mayor Gainey. The entire Department of Public Safety congratulates all of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Fire promotees and proclamation awardee Maxine Anthony and thanks them for their service to the City of Pittsburgh. PITTSBURGH, PA -- A much-anticipated class of Pittsburgh Police recruits graduated on Wednesday, March 6, 2024 during a ceremony at the Community College of Allegheny County auditorium. The group of twenty-four men and women from Basic Recruit class 23-01 began their in-classroom training on July 24, 2023 and is the first group of new officers hired in the city since 2020. Training Academy Commander William Fleske welcomed family and friends before introducing Chief Larry Scirotto who implored the new officers to focus as much on serving the community as protecting them. \"As you don the badge and embark on this journey, remember that every interaction is an opportunity to positively impact society. There aren't many professions that have the ability to influence society like that of a police officer. Engage with the community with an open heart. Be a source of reassurance and foster trust with your actions. It is in these moments that you can truly build a safer and more connected community,\" said Scirotto. Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt also encouraged the new officers to embrace the tenets of community policing as they continue their field training and embark on their careers in law enforcement. \"Our success as a department hinges on our ability to build strong, trusting relationships with the communities we serve. Take the time to listen to the concerns of residents, engage with local leaders, and work collaboratively to address the root causes of crime and disorder. True public safety is a collective effort and you are the frontline ambassadors in that effort.\" Mayor Ed Gainey addressed the new officers before administering the Oath of Office, reminding them that they are people first. \"Before you were a cop, you were a human being. Take your human heart and put it on that badge and go serve the community with all your soul and might. Every day when you are done, the city should feel better because you were there.\" said Mayor Gainey. Beginning Monday, March 11, the new officers will begin twelve weeks of supervised field training in their assigned zones. Congratulations to all of the new officers and welcome to the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police family! PITTSBURGH, PA -- It's that time of year again when Pittsburgh puts its black and gold pride aside to don shades of green and celebrate the city's Irish heritage on St. Patrick's Day. This year, March 17 falls on a Sunday, while the St. Patrick's Day parade will be held on Saturday, March 16, making for a full weekend of celebrations in the city. \"Department of Public Safety employees from all of the bureaus have been preparing for months to ensure residents and visitors can safely enjoy the parade and entertainment areas of the city this weekend. Working closely with the Pittsburgh Police Intelligence Unit, I am confident that the city is hosting a world-class parade in which everyone should feel comfortable participating,\" said Public Safety Director Lee Schmidt. For more than 150 years, the annual St. Patrick's Day parade has attracted huge crowds. This year, as many as 200,000 spectators are expected to line the route. The parade kicks off at 10 a.m. on Liberty Avenue and 11th Street at the edge of the Strip District, with staging beginning at 26th and Liberty at approximately 7 a.m. (See map below). The route proceeds down Grant Street from Liberty and turns right onto the Boulevard of the Allies before ending at the reviewing stand at Stanwix Street. \"No Parking\" signs have been placed along the 1.4 mile long parade route 48 hours in advance of the event, which is estimated to last about three-and-a-half hours. Tagging and towing will begin at 6 a.m. Saturday morning. Pittsburgh Police are fully staffed for the parade and festivities downtown, the South Side, and on the North Shore with law enforcement support from the Allegheny County Police, Pennsylvania State Police, and Port Authority Police. Pittsburgh EMS, Fire, Emergency Management and Homeland Security, and dozens of Public Safety Crossing guard personnel will also be supporting both the parade and entertainment areas throughout the city. The South Side, with its unique entertainment district along E. Carson Street, has traditionally been the focal point for St. Patrick's Day revelers. \"The South Side is known for its hospitality. The residents, business owners, and City of Pittsburgh staff are excited to welcome guests from all over the region to our great neighborhood. Public Safety has assembled an extensive team to keep everyone safe and Public Works will be on hand to keep the neighborhood clean. I look forward to seeing your Irish pride on Saturday,\" said District 3 Councilperson, Bob Charland. Starting this weekend and moving forward, Pittsburgh Police will also have a new substation on Mary Street which will be open from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. Wednesdays through Sundays. This will give officers the ability to attend roll call, complete paperwork, or take breaks when needed, while remaining close to the action on E. Carson, rather than having to return to the main station in Allentown. The building will not be open to the public and it will not be used as a place to hold or detain arrestees. The Department of Public Safety strongly encourages everyone who is celebrating this weekend to find a safe ride home either from a designated driver, via rideshare platforms, or public transit. This year, there are some convenient new ways to help make that easier. Rideshare drivers will have two assigned pick-up and drop-off lanes in the South Side. One will be located at S.18th St. from E. Carson to Wrights Way. The other will be at 20-26 Bedford Square off of S.12th Street. These designated lanes will help mitigate foot and vehicle traffic gridlock on Carson Street when the bars close. If you must drive into the city, please consider parking - free of charge - in the Second Avenue Parking Plaza. The large surface lot is a short walk to downtown restaurants and bars, as well as to the South Side via the 10th Street Bridge. (See map below). The weather is expected to be seasonal over the weekend with temperatures in the 40s and 50s and a chance of showers on Sunday, so please dress accordingly. \"The Department of Public Safety wishes everyone the luck of the Irish this weekend and I ask that you assist our first responders by celebrating responsibly and doing your part to keep our beautiful city safe this St. Patrick's Day,\" said Director Schmidt. For more tips on how to celebrate responsibly please visit the Office of Nighttime Economy Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/PGHnightEcon LEAD is an effective, replicable, and equitable diversion method that seeks to address the root causes of criminal justice involvement. PITTSBURGH — The Department of Public Safety’s Office of Community Health and Safety (OCHS) and Mayor Ed Gainey today celebrated the official launch of the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) program in the City of Pittsburgh. The LEAD initiative is a community-based diversion approach with the goals of improving public safety and public order, and reducing unnecessary justice system involvement of people who participate in the program. It will provide individuals with substance use disorder and mental and behavioral health challenges with intense case management and person-centered social services focused on harm reduction in lieu of criminalization. “When we unveiled the Pittsburgh Plan for Peace, we talked about the need to create high quality, diversionary programs and opportunities for those at risk for falling into a life of violence,\" said Mayor Ed Gainey. “Signing onto this MOU will help us provide these types of programs, and is a promise kept to the residents of Pittsburgh.” The city has been exploring a diversion program since 2019. In other cities, similar programs have been shown to pay for themselves in the long run by decreasing court costs and crime. Thanks to the collaboration amongst various stakeholders, the City of Pittsburgh’s program has been awarded funding to cover start-up costs and most programmatic expenses for the first three years. “A law enforcement assisted diversion program has been a work in progress for a number of years in the City of Pittsburgh,” said Lee Schmidt, Director of Public Safety. “We are excited to launch this prevention-focused program that connects critical communities to resources and social services and ultimately allows our first responders to focus on emergent needs.” The program will launch in Spring 2024 in Police Zones 1 and 2 and will center on individuals repeatedly arrested for low-level offenses associated with unmet behavioral health needs, trauma, and/or extreme poverty. Examples of such offenses include Retail Theft, Simple Possession, Possession of Paraphernalia, Prostitution, Public Intoxication, Simple Trespass, Defiant Trespass, Criminal Trespass, and Disorderly Conduct. “The LEAD program has demonstrated a reduction in recidivism, homelessness, overdoses, and the high utilization of 911 services,” said Chief of Police Larry Scirotto. “The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is proud to partner on such an initiative and looks forward to even better relationships between law enforcement personnel and the community.” LEAD is made possible through the committed coordination and support of numerous stakeholders, including the Allegheny County Health Department, Department of Human Services, CONNECT, District Attorney’s office, Public Defender’s office, Allegheny County Courts, Allegheny County Probation and Parole, Pittsburgh Bureau of Police, and the national LEAD Support Bureau. Additional information on the City of Pittsburgh’s Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) program can be found here. ### PITTSBURGH, PA -- In an effort to serve city residents and businesses in the most efficient and effective manner possible, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is making adjustments to the manner in which officers are dispatched to burglar alarm system activations in the city. Under the current model, Pittsburgh Police respond to all burglar alarms as priority calls, even if the alarm company is unable to reach the homeowner, business owner, or key holder to verify the alarm. This results in thousands of police staff hours each year for officers dispatched to alarms; the overwhelming majority of which are false. In response to this, the Bureau's Crime Analysis Unit was asked to compile data on the number of calls for service in 2023 for burglar alarms, and the police reports generated from those calls. The audit found the following: \"These 9,097 calls resulted in 4,166 police staff hours, or 174 days, with an average of 13.5 minutes per unit spent on burglar alarm responses. This is not a cost-effective or productive use of officers' time that could be spent bolstering community engagement efforts, increasing training time, expanding proactive patrols, and prioritizing officer wellness initiatives. Several cities across the U.S. have adopted this model which has resulted in cost savings for residents without sacrificing service quality or public safety,\" says Police of Chief, Larry Scirotto. Under the new model, officers will be dispatched to the following types of alarms as a priority response: Verified burglar alarms will be dispatched as high priority calls. Unverified burglar alarms will be dispatched with the same level of response given to other non-priority calls for service and placed in a queue. In advance of implementation, Chief Scirotto has outlined the new standard operating procedure for burglar alarm response in a bureau-wide memorandum to officers. The Allegheny County Emergency Operations Center (EOC) has also been made aware of the changes as they pertain to dispatch roles and responsibilities for residential and commercial burglar alarms. Upon receiving a burglar alarm activation, EOC dispatchers will attempt to verify the alarm and assign call priority based on whether the alarm is verified or unverified. In an effort to minimize Pittsburgh Police response to false alarms, the Pittsburgh Police Telephone Reporting Unit will begin documenting officer responses to false alarms and enforcing City of Pittsburgh ordinance 611.07, which pertains to penalties for false burglar alarms. In line with the ordinance, the alarm holder will be permitted two false alarm responses. For each false burglar alarm thereafter, the permit holder will be required to pay a fee. Upon the fifth documented false alarm activation in a calendar year, Pittsburgh Police supervisors are permitted to disregard the call. Last year, officers responded to nearly 1,500 repeat addresses, which generated 6,857 burglar alarms - or approximately 75% of all burglar alarm calls. One single address in the city resulted in 81 calls for service for burglar alarms in 2023, reinforcing the need to hold permit holders financially responsible for police response to multiple false alarms.

The Bureau of Animal Care & Control provides assistance to Bureaus within the Department of Public Safety, other City Departments and the Allegheny County Health Department in situations involving animals, both domestic and wild. The Bureau enforces City and State codes dealing with animals; issues citations and appears in court; helps to keep our City’s parks animal-nuisance free; works with non-profit animal shelters; provides consultation to other municipalities concerning animal issues; and assists the Pennsylvania Game Commission in tracking the rabies virus. Animal Care & Control Officers capture stray animals, assist in pet/owner recovery, resolve neighbor disputes over animals, assist the elderly and physically-challenged with animal concerns, advise and teach residents of their responsibility as pet owners, advise non-pet owners of their rights, and assist in the removal of nuisance wildlife. Nuisance wildlife is defined as wildlife that causes, or is about to cause, property damage or that presents a threat to the health or safety of the community by means of disease transmission or direct attacks. The Bureau also quarantines animals, provides removal of deceased animals, and assists police and the District Attorney's office with humane investigations. Although Animal Care & Control encourages responsible pet/companion ownership there are still over 1,300 dogs and cats picked up yearly. Many are reunited with their homes through a partnership the City has with a local animal shelter. Due to the wooded mountainous geography of our City, residents share common areas with a host of wildlife (skunks, raccoons, ground hogs, foxes, coyotes, deer, turkeys, etc.) Learn more about how to share space with wildlife by visiting our Living with Wild Life page.

Disruptive commercial properties threaten the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the City of Pittsburgh and burden its public safety services. When owners repeatedly violate the law by permitting illegal activities onsite or failing to properly maintain their commercial properties, the City may take action against them. Such action is reserved for repeated, unabated offenses. A commercial property may be designated as Disruptive pursuant to Chapter 670 only after a single felony violation or at least three citations for disruptive activity. Neighbors disturbed by properties in disrepair are advised to contact the City’s 3-1-1 Response Center to initiate a complaint. Designation as a Disruptive Property has serious consequences. The Public Safety Director is authorized to charge the property owner for all costs of law enforcement or public services called to a Disruptive Property. When a property violation remains unabated for an unreasonably long period of time, misdemeanor charges may also result.

The origins of the Pittsburgh Office of Emergency Management & Homeland Security (OEMHS) began in 1986 within its predecessor office, the Office of Safety and Inspections. The first emergency planner within this office was Raymond Demichiei. Tasked by former Pittsburgh Public Safety Director, Glenn Cannon to write an Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) for the EMS service, Demichiei created the first official emergency planning document for the City of Pittsburgh. In the late 1980’s following an initiative from the Commonwealth to address disaster emergencies, funding became available through the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Assistance Project for the official formation of emergency management agencies within Pennsylvania. These emergency management agencies would be responsible for activities involving protection, mitigation, response, and recovery operations for major metropolitan cities. With this new influx of funding, the Pittsburgh Emergency Management Agency (EMA) was officially formed in 1988 with Director Cannon as Emergency Management Coordinator and Demichiei as Deputy Director. The first major investment utilizing the new emergency management funding came in 1996 with the creation of the first City of Pittsburgh Emergency Operations Center (EOC). The EOC would serve as the central hub for information sharing and decision making for all significant incidents within the City. That same year came the first EOC activation, occurring in response to the Flood of 1996. In 1998 came the formation of the Southwestern Emergency Response Task Force comprised of the emergency management agencies of the 13 counties of Southwestern Pennsylvania and the City of Pittsburgh. This new task force, renamed the Region 13 Task Force, united all response and training assets within the region for the purpose of mutual aid, enhanced training capabilities, sharing critical infrastructure protection activities, and as a formal organization for the sharing of emergency management funding provided by federal and state resources. The task force funding also allowed for the hiring of two emergency planning staff members which were allocated to Pittsburgh EMA, becoming the first emergency management planners for the City. Following the 9/11 attacks came the establishment of the federal Department of Homeland Security (DHS). With the release of the DHS National Preparedness Goal initiative, it was recognized that Homeland Security begins with Hometown Security. As such, the Pittsburgh Emergency Management Agency expanded its mission area to include Homeland Security and altered the name of the organization to the Pittsburgh Office of Emergency Management & Homeland Security (OEMHS). The post 9/11 era also brought new federal preparedness and response funding for state and local agencies through the Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP). Through this program, Pittsburgh OEMHS was able to purchase various vehicles and equipment to fill response gaps created from the newly evolving threat landscape. These pieces of equipment and vehicles helped enhance operational abilities and address capability gaps within the City and Region. Pittsburgh was a pioneer in many pieces of equipment including the creation of the state of the art Pierce/LDV Mobile Command Post equipped with the latest technology to function as a free standing 911 center. The Bomb Squad received a new response vehicle and a remote controlled robot with capabilities not previously integrated into such equipment. A Lenco fully armored response vehicle was put into service in order to better protect SWAT officers responding to hostile events. The K-9 team received a first-of-its-kind vehicle capable of responding with up to eight teams and functioning as a base of operations. River Rescue took delivery of a second SeaArk rescue craft to enhance water borne capabilities. A new Hazmat response vehicle and a Mass Casualty unit were also placed in service. All of these vehicles and equipment are designated for regional response to any county in need throughout the Region 13 Task Force area. Today, Pittsburgh OEMHS continues to be the conduit for planning, coordination, and information sharing between the public and private sector in the mission areas of protection, prevention, mitigation, response, and recovery. An emergency plan is essential for everyone in your family. With a plan in place, everyone can get in contact and meet in a single location. Your browser does not support inline frames.

To support the city’s rapidly growing event & film industry, the Office of Film & Event Management has streamlined the permitting process for event organizers and film producers via efficient digital permitting. In addition to streamlining the permitting process for events & film projects in the City of Pittsburgh, the Office of Film & Event Management will also be responsible for the following: OFEM is tasked with receiving and vetting applications for small and large-scale events and film productions within the City of Pittsburgh as well as consulting with both film and event permit applicants to ensure that industry standards, safety regulations, and city policies are followed and met. Via the Special Events Committee, OFEM also works with all City departments to ensure proper planning, coordination, and execution of all events and film projects. Additionally, it will ensure that events and film productions do not negatively impact the City’s operations and remain positive assets to the City and its residents. Beginning in the spring of 2024, the Office of Film & Event Management (OFEM) launched a new permit management system, Eproval! With the launch of this new system came a new two-phase application approach to special event permitting. The new process allowed event organizers to secure their preferred venue first, and then focus on the details of the event. Previously, applicants had to wait until many details of their event were in place before they could apply. Now, applicants could secure their venue and dates, then move forward with hiring all of their vendors and performers with the comfort of knowing they had a secure venue and dates. Please see the release below for more information on EProval, and please visit the Special Event & Block Party Permitting page for information on the new application process. Please check out the 'Getting Started: Event Permits' document under the 'Important Documents' tab on the left for information on the entire permitting process! In addition to being able to secure their event venue prior to completing all event-specific details, Eproval provides several new exciting features that will make the event permitting process more streamlined for applicants. Among them: Scalable Application: During Phase Two of the application, applicants will be asked a series of yes/no questions up front, such as but not limited to: “will your event have a stage?” and “will you be having fireworks?” This allows the system to custom build an application specific to that event. If the event takes place in a park and does not impact any roadways, the applicant will not be presented with questions about road closures. If an event will not have fireworks, the applicant will not have to answer any questions about fireworks. This will minimize the length of the application for small community events, while larger more complex events will require more information. Public Event Calendar: During the application process, applicants will be given the opportunity to opt-in to our brand new public event calendar. This will be a forward facing calendar that will list all pending and approved event applications. Applicants who opt into being on the calendar can provide contact info and website information, as well as a quick two to three sentence marketing pitch. This calendar will be available on the City’s website for anyone to find when looking for things to do in the City.

To achieve this end, Planning works with communities, civic organizations and public entities to develop long-term plans to sustain and revitalize a thriving city of neighborhoods for the people who live, work, learn and visit here. Mission The Department of City Planning is a convener of residents, communities, civic organizations, commissions, and public entities, and works with these partners to plan and deliver a vision for the City’s future grounded in a Just Transition. The Department works at the intersection of climate change, racial justice, and social equity to ensure healthy, safe and vibrant neighborhoods for all residents. Because the built environment plays a vital role in the lives of Pittsburgh residents, City Planning incorporates policies and activities that promote sustainability, climate resilience, design justice, arts and culture, housing affordability and economic opportunity in the development and implementation of the City’s Comprehensive Plan, neighborhood plans, land use policies, zoning regulations, approval of development projects, and coordination of community development programs and partnerships. The Department is committed to focusing core planning activities to prioritize neighborhoods that have been harmed by past planning policies and practices which have contributed to existing racial and economic inequities throughout the city. This effort requires deeper engagement and additional resources in the development of plans and policies, working to remove barriers to the Department’s services, and by recognizing a more holistic set of metrics to advance the wellbeing of our diverse communities. The Department of City Planning recognizes the power of residents to transform their neighborhoods and calls on us to use that power to shape the future of Pittsburgh.

CDAP meets every other Tuesday, alternating with Planning Commission The Contextual Design Advisory Panel (CDAP) is comprised of eight members with expertise in the physical development of the City. The panel's mission is to promote quality of life in the City of Pittsburgh. CDAP achieves its mission through professional, voluntary design assistance to maximize the economic, civic, contextual, and aesthetic value of new development projects impacting the public realm. To fulfill this mission, CDAP advises the Department of City Planning by reviewing and providing design guidance on selected, higher profile projects throughout the City. CDAP is an advisory panel, not a commission. Together with staff design review, the panel works to resolve design issues through professional peer critique before a Commission conducts its review. This frees the the Commission to focus on its responsibility of assuring that new developments are consistent with the overall planning objectives of the City. Some examples of these core considerations are: Contextual Design Advisory Panel Members Design review is a collaborative process between City Planning and project's design team. Staff Design Review is the initial design review phase using information submitted by the applicant. City Planning staff develop a set of Urban Design Targets, which are tailored to the development proposal, the unique site conditions, and the neighborhood and context of the development. Staff work with the applicant to address the Urban Design Targets and to satisfy design-related zoning requirements. During the initial Staff Design Review phase, City Planning staff will recommend projects for review by CDAP. CDAP review is voluntary, but highly recommended for some projects. The applicant will update the design to address the Urban Design Targets and incorporate the staff’s comments, in preparation for the CDAP meeting. At the meeting, the project representative presents and discusses the project, surrounding context, and design concepts. CDAP members ask questions and make recommendations to the project representative. Projects that CDAP may review range from building additions to multi-parcel developments. Staff evaluates each project and its surrounding context and determines whether CDAP review would be beneficial. This determination will be made early in the review process. The criteria considered include the size of the project, complexity of the design context, and impact on the public realm. Generally, CDAP reviews: The most common format used for CDAP meetings follows the below outline. City Planning staff will introduce the Panel, provide a brief project introduction, and then refer to the project team for a presentation. The presentation should include a project outline and discuss context and design-related concepts and goals. The presentation should focus on design review and does not need to discuss Zoning or DOMI related reviews unless related to the overall design goals. After the CDAP meeting, City Planning staff sends a summary of the comments to the applicant. The applicant follows up with staff and responds to the comments by updating the design accordingly. City Planning staff will summarize the Design Review, including comments from CDAP and subsequent revisions, to convey design feedback and guidance to the Planning Commission, as the final approval determines. In some situations, projects will be reviewed twice by CDAP. At the second meeting, the project representative presents changes since the last meeting and provides additional visuals on the project as the design has developed. The second meeting may not be necessary for projects that meet the design objectives in the first full CDAP meeting. In addition to the regularly scheduled CDAP meetings, CDAP also holds workshops. Less like a formal review, a workshop is a collaborative meeting. The project representative brings their project goals and current design to the panel members who provide design guidance. CDAP can help the project representative meet their objectives while helping to create successful urban spaces. To contact CDAP via email, please email pacd@pittsburghpa.gov CDAP Rules and Procedures The Historic Review Commission meets on the first Wednesday of each month. Meetings starts at 1:00 PM.

Reviews are limited to proposed projects that will have a relatively minimal impact on the public realm. Projects may be eligible for Over-The-Counter approval based on the following criteria: Replacements: Projects which replace the form or content of existing elements or fixtures in order to repair, improve, or update existing implementations. Replacements may be either of the following: In Kind: Repair or replacement of existing elements or fixtures with identical products, or products of a similar aesthetic that have been slightly modified due to changes in cost, product availability, or updates. Content: Changes made to written content or images in order to provide updated information, branding, or imagery which maintain the same overall aesthetic. Negligible Changes: Projects that will have minimal to no impact on the public realm. Negligible changes may be either of the following: Low Visibility: Changes or additions that cannot be easily viewed from public property or the right-of-way. Minor change: Changes or additions that will not affect the general aesthetic of the site, would go unnoticed by a large portion of visitors to the site, or would be assumed by most viewers to be a standard element of City infrastructure. City Standards: Projects that fit within the City’s established design standards. Modifications: Changes to the design and/or aesthetic of projects that have previously been approved by the Public Art & Civic Design Commission.

Cultural and historic resources have a significant impact on Pittsburgh's character. They are valuable, non-replaceable assets that contribute to a unique and distinct sense of place. City Planning's Historic Preservation work is guided by PreservePGH, the Pittsburgh Cultural Heritage Plan, completed in 2012. PreservePGH's vision statement: In the 21st century, Pittsburgh's distinct character and culture will be preserved in ways that contribute to a high quality of life. The City will offer a balance of tradition and innovation, preservation and new construction, environmental sensitivity and continued use of resources. Pittsburgh's place in history will be admired and reflected for centuries to come - in the City's historic structures - in the waters of the three rivers - in the materials of modern buildings - in the hearts and minds of all Pittsburghers. How to Apply for Work to a Historic Property If you're interested in doing exterior work on a property that's located in a City-designated Historic District, approval by the Historic Review Commission is required.

Neighborhood planners participate in, and often coordinate, community plans. This group of planners acts as go-to people for explanations of zoning, development, transportation and other planning-related matters. Whether you're an individual or a representative of a community organization, neighborhood planners are here to help. This is a series of informational sessions coordinated by DCP to build up knowledge for the upcoming neighborhood plan process. Each session focuses on a different topic area. Most often, the series will be held in the neighborhood where there is a neighborhood planning process about to begin. The registered community organization program establishes a set of standards for community-based organizations. If the organization meets these standards, it can initiate a process where it follows the standards in this guide to create a neighborhood plan that may be adopted by the Planning Commission. The public engagement guide outlines a framework for how the City should conduct engagement efforts throughout the next phases of the comprehensive planning process and establishes guidelines for improving the approach to engagement more broadly. The guide was developed through a collaboration of residents, community organizations, and City Planning. It is designed to help increase engagement with the planning process. In collaboration with public agencies and community planning partners, City Planning has developed the Neighborhood Plan Guide to establish a framework for how to create high-quality and consistent neighborhood plans. This guide creates a standard for the development of neighborhood plans that can be adopted by the Planning Commission. The City of Pittsburgh will initiate these planning processes in most instances and will use this document to guide its work. Registered Community Organizations can also initiate the neighborhood planning process and work with public agencies to follow these standards and adopt a plan.

As one means to achieve this mission, DOMI evaluates the impact of certain development actions on the City’s multimodal transportation network. Review actions may include land development-related activities such as: Access more information on the Curb Cuts page. The level of transportation review required for a land development project is tailored to the scale, use, context, and unique features of the proposed site and runs concurrent with Department of City Planning (DCP) Zoning review. For some projects, DOMI simply acts as reviewer for the site plan submitted to Zoning. For other developments, additional material and studies are needed for DOMI to fully evaluate the impact of the proposed project. In the latter case, DCP staff will advise the application if the land development proposal may require additional review such as a transportation impact study or ROW improvement plan. A Transportation Impact Study (TIS) will be required when a development is anticipated to impact the adjacent roadway network in a manner where network capacity impacts are expected and mitigations are necessary in order to support the proposed development. The scope of the TIS will be determined during a scoping meeting with DOMI. The following documents were developed to provide guidance on the transportation review process. Transportation demand management (TDM) refers to the tools and strategies used to increase the efficiency of the transportation network by meeting the demand for travel through transportation options that do not contribute to peak hour vehicle congestion. The goal of TDM is to reduce single occupancy vehicle trips by making it easier and more attractive for travelers to utilize transit, biking, walking, and other efficient travel options. TDM plans for new developments are identified during the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) transportation impact review process for development projects. Before work within public right-of-way can begin, the appropriate permit(s) shall be obtained from the applicable DOMI permit office. Improvements within the public ROW which alter the existing geometry, composition, or operation of the right(s)-of-way (i.e. Topographical changes, curb line modification, intersection upgrades, new public infrastructure, etc.) require a ROW Improvement Plan.

PLI enforces the International Property Maintenance Code (\"IPMC\") as adopted by the City of Pittsburgh Code of Ordinances Title 10 Chapter 1004. PLI also enforces the Zoning Code – Title Nine. Most inspections start with requests that are called, texted, tweeted or electronically submitted to the 311 Response Center. The requests are anonymous, and each request prompts an inspection. Once an inspector gets a request, the inspector follows a standardized process that was created to make sure that property owners get a legal Request for Compliance and a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue. If you get a Request for Compliance and want to talk to the inspector, please call their direct number, which is on the request. Here is an example of a Request for Compliance: If you must leave a voicemail, the inspector will make every effort to call you back as quickly as possible. Please give them a day to respond. When you talk to the inspector, you can talk about the request, try to work out the issue, and/or schedule an appointment or follow-up inspection. If you do not respond to the Request for Compliance and do not fix the violation, the inspector will do a second inspection and send a second request. Again, you can still call the inspector, try to work things out, and fix the violation. If the issue is not fixed by the deadline in the second request, the inspector does a third and final inspection. If the inspector finds the same violation, you will receive a third notice, and a criminal court complaint will be filed with the local magisterial district judge. Once the judge receives the complaint, the judge will schedule a hearing and serve the hearing documents on the property owner of record. If you are found guilty at the hearing, the judge can impose a fine. If you do not pay the fine, the judge can find you in contempt and send you to jail. To hopefully avoid all of those things, even though it is ultimately up to the judge to decide what to do once a complaint has been filed, PLI encourages you to work with your inspector and fix the violations.

When a structure has been declared a public safety hazard, PLI will condemn the building. A building may be condemned for a number of reasons including: These violations are from the International Property Maintenance Code –Title 10 as adopted and amended by City Code. There may be several remedies for a property owner of a condemned structure dependent upon the condition such as: A structure may be condemned for a number of years before PLI considers a City funded demolition. The structure must be considered an imminent danger. The definition of imminent danger according to the International Property Maintenance Code is “a condition which could cause serious or life-threatening injury or death at any time” Please review our Razed, Condemned, and Under Contract documents for specific properties in these categories.

PDEC has identified four areas of greatest need for digital equity programming and defined equity outcomes for each goal. In their final report, due this summer, PDEC will provide specific recommendations to address each of the four areas. According to the latest available release of American Community Survey data: Local surveys, national surveys, and anecdotal evidence demonstrate that affordability is the biggest reason households do not subscribe to broadband, and a lack of understanding for how to use a computer is a major contributing factor. Additionally, a 2022 Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission report on Equitable Broadband Access indicates that Seniors, Families with K-12 students, and Black citizens are disproportionately disconnected, and efforts should be taken to help these key populations. A coordinated effort led by County and City officials along with leaders from other anchor institutions provided the Pittsburgh region with the opportunity to submit well-rounded applications for enough funding to make digital equity a reality in the years to come. This plan comprehensively addresses the gaps in digital skills, low-cost high-speed internet services, as well as access to devices and technical assistance.

USDA (US Department of Agriculture protocol) How to Build a Spotted Lanternfly Circle Trap (psu.edu) As far as a chemical control goes, this is what Penn State University has. Spotted Lanternfly Management and Pesticide Safety Article Chemical Treatment Cost Prohibited and Non-Effective in Long Run Systemic control, injection, $15 an inch of trunk diameter, so for example a 10 inch street tree would cost around $150.00 and wouldn't help with the lanternflies on nearby grape vines and porcelain berry, so it would have a primarily cosmetic effect for a couple of weeks. It would take months to inject all of the trees, by which point the season would be coming to a close. Foliar spraying would be faster, but significantly more dangerous to both the safety of our water supplies, native insect and reptile species, pets, and park-users, and pedestrians, as it would involve essentially fogging the forest or streets with insecticides. It would work for a couple of weeks, and then they would move in from the surrounding infected parts of the County and City and we'd be back to square one. I don't really have a price estimate for foliar work, as it is done by time and materials. Pittsburgh Urban Forest Discover how Pittsburgh enhances its neighborhoods with trees.

The Zoning Division is the first stop for getting most construction permits in the City of Pittsburgh. The approval processes involved vary by project type, the scope of work, and location (see the Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections for more information). The City of Pittsburgh Zoning Code regulates land use and activities within the City boundaries. The intent of zoning regulations is to allow property owners the reasonable use of their property insofar as the use is not detrimental to abutting properties or to the neighborhood. The City of Pittsburgh is divided into different Zoning Districts that regulate the potential uses of a property. Interactive maps show the zoning and parcel information. Note: the current Certificate(s) of Occupancy for particular property documents explain how that property is legally allowed to be used. Get answers to your frequently asked questions about zoning in the City of Pittsburgh! Find applications reviewed by the Department of City Planning here. Applications submitted to the Department of City Planning for review may require Zoning Review and/or one or more of the Planning reviews, public notices and/or public hearings depending on the location and scope of work. The City of Pittsburgh is committed to implementing policies that promote, produce, and preserve affordable housing options throughout the City that are safe, healthy and let all residents thrive.

All applications will start at the OneStopPGH online portal. Most building permits, which are issued by the Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections, require zoning approval, also known as the Record of Zoning Approval or ROZA, including those for interior renovations when changing the use of the structure. However, only some will require a site plan (new parking, additions, HVAC, etc.). See Site Plan Requirements for details. Please note: This document only covers work not requiring a Building Permit and/or a ROZA. A Certificate of Appropriateness may still be required for work on locally designated historic structures or structures in locally designated historic districts.

Revised: 7/5/2019 Yes, once an application has been filed, it is public record. Please email zoning@pittsburghpa.gov with the request. For older files, or for large or complex requests, please file a Right to Know request. Make this request online or email openrecords@pittsburgh.pa.gov. All Certificates of Occupancy can be searched online. Yes, an interactive zoning map is available. Not necessarily. Even when the district allows a two-family dwelling, all applicable code requirements must be met in order for that use to be approved for a specific location. These requirements include side yard setbacks, lot area, and parking requirements. Please consult with Zoning staff. Make sure the intention is to change the zoning district of a property rather than simply wanting to change the use of the property (more common). If the intent is to change the use of the property, please consult zoning staff for the appropriate process. In most cases, rezoning land is done at a larger scale with multiple parcels rather than a single property or for a single development. There are a few exceptions, and if you are interested in filing for a rezoning application, please file a pre-application request. A property certification is required whenever there is a real estate closing on a property due to a sale or refinance. (Note: this is the same thing that used to be called the zoning certificate.) It is a document intended for the benefit of a buyer or lender to let them know the zoning district of the property, the legality of use, if there is an occupancy permit on file, if the property is in a local historic district, and if there are any active code violations on file. Property line issues are not handled by the City. You should contact a magistrate or an attorney. A home occupation can typically be approved through Basic Zoning Review. The Zoning Code criteria for review of home occupation is listed in 912.05. See the Consolidations/Subdivisions page for information about this process and appropriate contacts. The Zoning Code is available on the Municode website. Select Title Nine for the Zoning Code. Visit the Real Estate Division in the Finance Department website or call them at 412-255-2300. Visit the Department of City Planning’s floodplain website. Make your request through the 311 Response Center. Department of Mobility and Infrastructure will contact you regarding your request. Beginning October 3, 2022, new Zoning (ZDR) and PLI applications with work occurring in the floodplain will apply for a Floodplain Permit though the OneStopPGH portal. This permit type will replace the floodplain review currently housed in Zoning Development Review (ZDR). With this new formatting of the application, applicants will be able to apply for a single floodplain review for the entire construction project; check the boxes to identify all of your work. Please see PLI's Floodplain Review Policy for in-depth information.

City of Pittsburgh 414 Grant St. Pittsburgh, PA 15219 (Accessibility entrance on Ross St.) View on Map 412-255-2621\n================================================================================\n\nTitle: Planning Reviews, Public Notices and Public Hearings - Pittsburgh, PA\nContent: In This Section Applications submitted to the Department of City Planning for review may require Zoning Review and/or one or more of the Planning reviews, public notices and/or public hearings listed below depending on the location and scope of work. Please note that this list is not exhaustive, but includes the most common components. Zoning Review is the overarching review for most Zoning Development Review applications. There are three levels of Zoning Review: Basic Zoning Review, Site Plan Review, and Zoning Review with Planning Commission. The level of review applicable for any given project will depend on the location and scope of work for that project. Below is a general overview of the three levels of Zoning Review. In some cases, the Zoning Review will be contingent upon the successful completion of one or more additional reviews, posted notices and/or public hearings administered or coordinated by the Department of City Planning. These additional components also depend on the location and scope of work. In addition, if the project location does not have a valid address, final approval will not be issued until an Address Request application has been successfully completed and an Address Verification Letter has been issued. Projects that successfully complete the Zoning Review Process typically receive at least one approval document called the Record of Zoning Approval (ROZA), but may also receive others such as the Certificate of Appropriateness, to submit to the Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections along with any other required documentation in order to apply for the appropriate permits issued by that department. All development review projects, including signs, require a Zoning and Development Review Application, which may be submitted through the OneStopPGH online portal. Most applications filed online require a filing fee, paid via credit card or e-check. (Please note a service charge will apply). Hard copy applications and checks may still be mailed or dropped off at the OneStopPGH Counter, 412 Boulevard of the Allies, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, open daily from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. City of Pittsburgh 414 Grant St. Pittsburgh, PA 15219 (Accessibility entrance on Ross St.) View on Map 412-255-2621\n================================================================================\n\nTitle: Housing - Pittsburgh, PA\nContent: In This Section The City of Pittsburgh is committed to implementing policies that promote, produce, and preserve affordable housing options throughout the City that are safe, healthy and let all residents thrive. Inclusionary Zoning (IZ) ensures that neighborhoods can offer new housing units by tying the construction of affordable housing to that of market-rate housing. It is used in a variety of cities across the country, and was identified by the City’s Affordable Housing Task Force (AHTF, 2016) as a tool that could work here in Pittsburgh to address the shortage of affordable units. U.S. Department of HUD 2023 adjusted home income limits What do you mean by “affordable”? Rent or sale prices are based at certain percentages of the Area Median Income (AMI), which is defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Department and varies by household size. For-rent inclusionary units will be set aside for households earning no more than 50% of AMI. For-sale inclusionary units, will be set aside for households earning no more than 80% of AMI. Inclusionary units will be priced at no more than 30% of income, based on these AMI standards. For example, using these pricing standards, a two-bedroom unit would rent for no more than $855, and a two-bedroom home would be listed for sale at no more than $128,000. Where has the Inclusionary Zoning ordinance been adopted? Currently, the Inclusionary Zoning ordinance is applicable in Lawrenceville, Bloomfield, and Polish Hill.

Before entering the program, the company had only piloted their product in residential facilities. While participating in the program, the company was able to test its new technology at a larger scale on the 11th floor of the Ross Street Building where the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is located. By learning about the URA’s HVAC system, HiberSense discovered that the local authority could potentially save 20% in energy savings. Startup: TransitSource Partner: Department of Planning, City of Pittsburgh Pilot Program: TransitSource was one of the three startups in the first cohort of PGH Lab. The startup piloted its Sentinel Boxes, a bike-mounted piece of hardware that detects and reports close calls for cyclists, or events where a motor-vehicle narrowly passes a bicycle. The device interfaces with the cyclist's smartphone to record GPS location, time of day, passing distance, moving speed of the passing vehicle and a picture of the event. The startup tested its Sentinel Box on one of Pittsburgh’s busiest streets, Negley Avenue. With the help of four dedicated volunteers, the seven-week pilot program yielded a total of 239 trips equal to 65 miles on the road. This was the first time the Sentinel Boxes were tested on a larger scale. TransitSource reported that of the 7,604 passing events, 2,500 were within four feet of the bicyclist which, in the state of Pennsylvania, that is considered to be an ‘unsafe pass’. Results from the pilot period concluded that 1 in 3 passing events were not only unsafe, but unlawful. Startup: CleanRobotics Partner: Department of Public Works, City of Pittsburgh Pilot Program: The startup company tested its flagship product, the Trashbot. The TrashBot uses advanced robotics and artificial intelligence to sort recyclables from waste at the point of disposal. This process drastically increases the recycling yield and improves its quality through reduced contamination. In coordination with the Office of Environmental services, the Trashbot was placed on the first floor of the City-County Building. The first floor of the City-County Building provided an ideal location to test the Trashbot and its use as it is a highly transited area. The Trashbot was tested for one week. In addition, the startup was able to run surveys that tested the look and feel of the Trashbot. Startup: Kaarta Partner: Department of Public Works, City of Pittsburgh Pilot Program: Kaarta tested its 3D scanning technology that blends multiple advanced sensors — a 360° lidar laser scanner, a motion sensor, and a feature tracker — to survey its environment and accurately determine where it is and what’s around it. The startup tested its 3D scanner technology in two different settings with the help of the Department of Public Works at the City of Pittsburgh. Their case studies included an abandoned building where the company used its technology to show the extent of the interior damage and site components and a department of public works warehouse to map the location of inventory in the building. Read more about this pilot here. Startup: MellonHead Lab Partner: Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA) Pilot Program: The startup company tested its CATTfish water sensor with the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority (PWSA). The sensor is used by both citizens and industry to track water quality changes over long periods of time and large geographic areas. Cloud based visualization of large data sets allows easy interpretation of results. The company gained access to a water plant owned by PWSA to test its larger size water quality sensor called Flamingo. The startup company was able to gain and report data to PWSA regarding the water quality of one of its plants. < Startup: NetBeez Partner: Department of Innovation & Performance, City of Pittsburgh Pilot Program: Netbeez’s technology allows for early off-site detection — therefore reducing location visits and time required by network engineers to check on network performance. In partnership with the Department of Innovation & Performance, the startup company wanted to help the City of Pittsburgh monitor its network performance on a day-to-day basis to identify problems before they occur. The company deployed eight sensors since February 2018, which have been providing information to City of Pittsburgh network engineers. Some sensors were placed in the Department of Innovation & Performance and Council Chambers where there is access to public Wi-Fi. After the pilot project the startup was able to continue its engagement with the Department of Innovation & Performance with a paid contract. Startup: Global Wordsmiths Partner: Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh (HACP) Pilot Program: Global Wordsmiths is a social enterprise dedicated to improving language access for Limited English Proficiency (LEP) individuals. The startup helps organizations to incorporate, learn, and implement language access services through a customized strategic Language Access plan. Global Wordsmiths tested its language access consulting stack with the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh (HACP). The startup implemented a series of interviews and training for HACP's customer facing employees in the Occupancy Department, the first point of contact for Low-income Housing Program and the Housing Choice Voucher Program. Startup: Zensors Partner: Pittsburgh Parking Authority Pilot Program: Zensors uses artificial intelligence via a camera software system to provide human-centered and actionable sensor output with minimal hardware installation. The product allows the user to make data-driven decisions. The startup worked with the Pittsburgh Parking Authority on a dynamic pricing study of a busy commercial street in the city. The startup deployed 13 cameras equipped with the AI software to gain real data for the study. Startup: Meta Mesh Wireless Communities Partner: Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh Pilot Program: Meta Mesh is a non-profit organization that bridges the digital divide in Western Pennsylvania by using mesh networking technology to provide communities with a low-cost public WiFi option. Meta Mesh builds these networks and teaches others about networking and WiFi. The startup company worked with the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh (HACP) to gain access to high buildings to test its mesh networking capabilities with the goal of providing outside free wireless access to residents living in three HACP buildings. Startup: Qlicket Partner: Urban Redevelopment Authority Pilot Program: Qlicket provides an office communication solution that offers organizations a simple, natural way to solicit feedback. Qlicket’s software drives engagement and helps companies address workplace issues more effectively by providing the most direct and scalable way to hear and respond to the voice of their employees. The startup tested its desktop communications platform in a organization wide pilot project at the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA). The startup engaged URA employees with daily questions about their workplace environment and fun engaging questions customized by the URA’s Human Resource Director. The average employee response rate during the pilot period was 73 % . After the pilot period, the company introduced its new product, an interactive kiosk that encourages greater employee communications and engagement.

Yes, if you have an innovative service that presents great potential to improve city operations and help the City of Pittsburgh deliver quality services, tell us how your service works. Refer to FlyWheelandGlobal Wordsmiths pilot projects for inspiration. The goal for both startups and the City is to have successfully completed pilots with measurable outcomes. To that end, a startup must have time, staff, equipment, and other required resources to sustain and complete a pilot for up to 6 months. In addition, the startup is required to allocate time for bi-weekly check-in meetings with program manager, meetings with city champions, and a company presentation day. Please check thePGH Lab Rules & Regulations Bookletfor detailed information on company expectations. PGH Lab’s OpenGov solicitation should only be used for submittals by organizations interested in participating in the PGH Lab program. This is not a venue to sell the City of Pittsburgh products or services, initiate a procurement agreement, become an approved vendor, or respond to an RFP outside of the PGH Lab program. Please refer to Beacon and City Procurement Procedures for these actions. PGH Lab defines “startup” according to the phase a pilot product is in rather than the age or size of the company. If you have products or services with revenue streams but have a pilot-ready product that is pre-customer, you should still apply. The pilot would only test that beta phase product. Participants in the PGH Lab program will receive public attention from local news outlets. However, the PGH Lab program is not the portal for requesting a formal letter of support from the Mayor. The city will provide a dedicated program liaison, access to any equipment, infrastructure, or staff required to successfully execute the pilot. In addition, participants will be paid $25,000 in 6 installments over the course of the program. Startups have an opportunity to test their product. This test case is valuable in seeking investors and customers. Startups will also be connected to a range of city resources. Startups are encouraged to test, gain valuable market feedback, and iterate.

Coordinated, concentrated and comprehensive carbon mitigation action is needed to reduce the severity of regional impacts and prepare for low carbon economy. To address these challenges, Pittsburgh has created the Climate Action Plan. Climate Action Plan 3.0 lays out strategies through which Pittsburgh can reduce greenhouse gas emissions within city limits and within City operations. This will lessen Pittsburgh’s contribution to global climate change. Pittsburgh’s goal is to measure climate and ecological impact, and report findings, annually. The Greenhouse Gas Inventory quantifies emissions and analyzes the sources of those emissions. This data helps to inform mitigation strategies and is essential for tracking progress toward future reduction goals. Chapter One 2018 Greenhouse Gas Inventory By 2030, Pittsburgh will reduce emissions by 50% from 2003 amounts and power all City facilities with 100% clean energy. Through efforts to reduce line loss and modernizing energy systems, this goal can become a reality. Chapter Two As part of fighting climate change in our city, Pittsburgh’s goal is to reduce energy and water consumption by 50% by 2030. This goal can be achieved through improving the quality of energy and water use data, ensuring all new buildings are carbon neutral, mitigating high energy burdens in vulnerable communities, reducing sewer volume by 50% from 2013 levels, and improving efficiency of public street lights and traffic signals. Chapter Three Pittsburgh’s goals are to reduce on-road transportation emissions by 50%, reduce vehicle miles traveled per capita by 50%, reduce freight emissions by 25%, and increase vehicle electrification. Through increasing walking and biking commutes, increasing Port Authority bus and light rail ridership, and expanding transit hubs, these goals can be achieved. Chapter Four Pittsburgh strives to be zero-waste landfilled by 2030. By modernizing waste collection systems, improving education around waste diversion efforts, increasing composting, and enforcing waste policies, Pittsburgh can reach this goal. Chapter Five Improving local food systems in the Greater Pittsburgh area is a key piece of climate mitigation for the city. Increasing the supply and demand of local produce strengthens the local food system, increases local profitability, and decreases the climate impact of transportation and sales. Chapter Six Urban ecosystems—cities, towns and urban strips constructed by humans—impact the environment around them. Pittsburgh’s goal is to increase tree canopy and biodiversity, improve urban soil conditions, prioritize habitat conversion, and implement guidelines for additional greenways. Chapter Seven Pittsburgh has established six climate mitigation goals to achieve by 2030, including: Pittsburgh is committed to: Through leveraging grant funding and vehicle turnover cycles, the City of Pittsburgh has been purchasing alternatively fueled and hybrid vehicles for its fleet as technology becomes available. These vehicles incluse electric sedans for building inspectors, hybrid police vehicles, and CNG refuse trucks. In 2019, the Sustainability & Resilience division convened an Electric Vehicle Task Force to provide recommendations to enable residents and fleets to easily charge and operate electric vehicles. In 2021, the City, in partnership with the American Cities Climate Challenge and the Pittsburgh Parking Authority, developed an EV Charging Strategic Plan for Pittsburgh Public Facilities. Read both documents below. EV Task Force Recommendations(PDF, 1MB) EV Charging Strategic Plan for Pittsburgh Public Facilities(PDF, 4MB) The Climate Challenge is a Bloomberg Philanthropies initiative that aims to accelerate and deepen U.S. cities’ efforts to create the greatest impact through 2020 and showcase the benefits that climate solutions bring, like good jobs, cleaner air and cost savings. Pittsburgh is one of 25 cities chosen for its vision and leadership on climate action and is tackling carbon emissions in the four key areas of the Climate Challenge: reducing building energy use, increasing renewable energy, reducing vehicle travel and electrifying vehicles.

Inequality. Public health challenges. Flash floods. Infrastructure failure. Extreme weather. There are just a few of the chronic stressors and acute shocks that challenge and threaten Pittsburgh. Though Pittsburgh has made significant progress in improving environmental stewardship and transitioning from a city in decline to a thriving hub of innovation, technology, education and medicine, we recognize there is still a need for focused, inclusive efforts to ensure all Pittsburgh residents and visitors live well and succeed. In 2014, the City of Pittsburgh joined the 100 Resilient Cities Network, powered by the Rockefeller Foundation, and with the support of the RAND Corporation, has since engaged with more than 2,000 Pittsburghers to understand the City's resilience challenges and develop analyses, reports and actions to address them. Pittsburgh's Preliminary Resilience Assessment(PDF, 28MB) The City of Pittsburgh began the Pittsburgh Equity Indicators project in 2017 to assess annual progress toward equitable opportunities and outcomes for Pittsburghers of all races, genders and incomes, and to inform the City's investment decisions. Support by funding and guidance from the City University of New York Institute for State and Local Governance, the research team led by the RAND Corporation developed a framework and associated indicators to measure equality in both outcomes and opportunities in Pittsburgh. The City of Pittsburgh received technical support and resources from a variety of organizations and companies to strengthen particular areas of concern including stormwater management, cybersecurity, mobility, air quality, waste and energy production. These partnerships include: City of Pittsburgh 414 Grant St. Pittsburgh, PA 15219 (Accessibility entrance on Ross St.) View on Map 412-255-2621\n================================================================================\n\nTitle: Food Systems - Pittsburgh, PA\nContent: In This Section In a city where more than 1 in 5 residents face food insecurity—more than twice the national average—there is a critical need for the City of Pittsburgh to intervene through leadership and collaboration. Tackling this issue will require input from a variety of actors, such as the City, nonprofits, city agents, but most importantly, the local Pittsburgh community. Local food is a crucial component in confronting the issue of food insecurity. Local food is defined as food that was grown or produced within a certain radius of where it is consumed. Local food movements aim to connect food producers and consumers in the same geographic region to develop more self-reliant and resilient food networks. Local food is fresher, lasts longer, and tastes better than food that has traveled hundreds of miles. Buying local food also has huge positive effects on the environment – by buying food that has traveled fewer miles and that was grown without pesticides and high gas emission practices, our food can help us live in a more sustainable way.

These companies will collaborate with various city departments to test cutting-edge technologies and services, contributing to the growth and evolution of Pittsburgh's civic landscape. “PGH Lab is a shining example of Pittsburgh’s dedication to innovation,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “By offering a collaborative platform where startups can work directly with city departments, we’re not only cultivating homegrown solutions to civic challenges but also empowering our local businesses to grow and thrive.” Founded in 2016, PGH Lab provides a unique six-month paid program designed to support local startups as they pilot their products with the city government. In 2024, the program introduced a $25,000 stipend for each participating company, underscoring the city’s commitment to recognizing and rewarding the value of innovation. Participants benefit from invaluable feedback, access to municipal leaders, and the opportunity to contribute to the city's ongoing efforts to enhance government efficiency, transparency, sustainability, and inclusivity. “For nearly a decade, PGH Lab has supported local entrepreneurs in preparing their products and services for the public market,” said Heidi Norman, Director of Innovation & Performance. “Last year, we pivoted from being a public market test bed to a true ‘first customer’ program that incorporates an RFP procurement process, selection committee, legal contracts, and invoiced payments. This change ensures our participants gain a full vendor-partner lifecycle experience from day one. By doing so, we reinforce our local government’s commitment to fostering inclusive partnerships and meaningful collaborations that help local businesses successfully compete and expand.” The four companies selected for PGH Lab Cohort 10.0 were chosen from a competitive pool of 18 applicants. This year’s diverse cohort includes: Ethos Collaborative: Partnering with the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure to develop an IoT-driven digital twin platform, fostering real-time engagement and stakeholder interaction. Make it Home Safe: Collaborating with the Department of Public Safety to explore implementation options for safety-focused technology designed to enhance public well-being. Reclamation Factory: Working with the Department of Public Works and the Office of Sustainability and Resilience to trace and process post-consumer plastic waste, promoting more sustainable recycling practices. Vridian: Teaming up with the Department of Finance to enhance the Treasurer’s Sale process by leveraging digital twin technology to improve accuracy and transparency. Through the PGH Lab program, these startups will not only refine their products and services but also contribute to the development of innovative solutions that drive positive change in Pittsburgh’s government operations and communities. The city remains committed to cultivating impactful public-private partnerships that create meaningful, lasting improvements.

This groundbreaking program would provide significant relief to long-term homeowners in neighborhoods experiencing rapid property value increases, preventing the displacement of those who have invested in and nurtured their communities. If adopted by Council, the LOOP program would ensure that Pittsburgh residents who have contributed to the character and vibrancy of their neighborhoods will be able to continue living in the homes they’ve cherished, despite the pressures of development on property values. “I’m proud to submit this legislation that will help keep people in the houses they made into homes,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “No resident should be forced out of their neighborhood due to development, and LOOP is an important step toward ensuring that Pittsburgh’s residents can continue to call their communities home.” The LOOP program offers tax relief to homeowners in rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods by exempting or deferring property tax increases for those who meet specific eligibility criteria. This includes homeowners who have lived in their property for at least ten continuous years, or five years if they’ve received assistance from a government or nonprofit housing program. Additional eligibility factors include the increase in property assessment value, household income level, and the timeliness of tax payments. Key Eligibility Requirements for LOOP: Longtime Owner Occupant: Homeowners must have owned and lived in the same property for at least 10 years (or 5 years if they received housing assistance). Property Assessment Increase: Homeowners must experience an assessment value increase of more than 25% from one year to the next, or a 50% increase over a 5-year period. Income: Household income must be at or below 120% of the Area Median Income. Tax Payments: All real estate taxes must be current, or a payment plan must be in place with the Department of Finance. Pittsburgh’s commitment to preserving affordable housing amidst growing gentrification pressures is stronger than ever. Mayor Gainey’s leadership ensures that LOOP will be implemented efficiently and equitably. The application period for the program would run annually from January 1st to June 30th, with exemptions applied retroactively to the current tax year. Participants would then automatically receive the exemption each year until they sell their home or no longer meet eligibility requirements. Mayor Gainey Announced the submission of LOOP authorizing legislation as part of the Keep Pittsburgh Home campaign, a multi-pronged effort to address the root causes of Pittsburgh’s housing affordability crisis by pursuing funding and legal reforms to increase funding for affordable housing development, change regulations to encourage more housing construction, and combat displacement caused by real estate speculation and gentrification. The event also highlighted the successes of other homeownership programs implemented or supported by the Gainey Administration, including OwnPGH, the Homeowner Assistance Program, and the Whole Home Repair Program. Through the OwnPGH program, the Gainey administration is breaking down historic barriers to homeownership. This program provides crucial down payment assistance for first-time buyers and has already helped 150 homeowners—88% of whom are women heads of household or from communities historically excluded from homeownership. OwnPGH is playing a critical role in closing Pittsburgh’s racial and gender homeownership gaps, addressing disparities where Black Pittsburghers are more than twice as likely to be denied a mortgage as white applicants, and women—especially women of color—face disproportionately higher financial and systemic barriers to homeownership. OwnPGH directly addresses these inequities, ensuring more families can own, stay, and build wealth in Pittsburgh. “Keeping people in their homes isn’t just about helping them buy; it’s about ensuring they can afford to stay,” said Mayor Gainey. “Too many longtime homeowners are forced to sell, not because they want to leave, but because they cannot afford necessary repairs or rising costs in their own neighborhoods.” Both the Homeowner Assistance Program (HAP) and the Whole-Home Repairs Program prioritize neighborhood stability by addressing critical repairs and avoiding financial burdens that could lead to displacement. These programs are part of a broader strategy to protect homeownership and prevent displacement in Pittsburgh. The City is also focused on: Keeping Public Tools for the People: Strengthening the Land Bank and investing in public housing to ensure long-term affordability. Stopping Housing from Becoming Hotels: Enforcing short-term rental regulations to curb speculation. Preventing Displacement: Expanding affordable housing, leveraging housing bonds, and using public tools to keep residents in their neighborhoods. Making Homeownership Possible: Creating more pathways for first-time buyers to own homes and build stability. Protecting Renters: Stopping unfair evictions and rent hikes that push families out. Fighting Predatory Investors: Limiting speculation to keep homes in the hands of Pittsburghers. Why These Programs Matter Expanding access to homeownership means creating stability, building generational wealth, and strengthening neighborhoods. Too many Pittsburghers are at risk of being pushed out due to speculation and rising costs, struggling to find stable housing. With these efforts, Pittsburgh is taking decisive action to ensure that its residents—regardless of their background or income—can continue to thrive and build a future in the neighborhoods they’ve made their own.
