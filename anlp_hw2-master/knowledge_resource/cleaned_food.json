    "https://www.pghtacofest.com/about": "The Pittsburgh Taco Festival is an annual food festival aimed at celebrating (and eating) TACOS, as well as supporting and raising funds and awareness for the citys Latin-American community. The Original Pittsburgh Taco Festival was founded in 2016 by Craig McCloud who sought to create an opportunity which benefitted food trucks/start-ups as well as support non-profits that serve the citys burgeoning Latin American population. The festival regularly attracts vendors from beyond the metro area, as well as visitors who plan weekend visits from New York, Ohio, Maryland, West Virginia, and beyond. Over the years, tens of thousands of people have joined us for what has become an annually anticipated cultural and community event. We hope youll join us, too! In addition to the many corporate and national sponsors that support our mission, we are most proud of our cultural partnerships. We work closely with Pittsburgh Hispanic Development Corporation (PHDC) and Casa San Jose, because we wish to honor the cultures responsible for what we consider the greatest hand-food known to man. These organizations help us recruit vendors, organize entertainment, and provide authenticity to our taco-themed event. In turn they receive a generous percentage of the net proceeds. 2875 Railroad St, Pittsburgh, PA 15222 PR@pghtacofest.com Div 1: HomeaboutvendorsmapFAQSbuy tickets Div 3: Home Div 6: about Div 8: vendors Div 10: map Div 12: FAQS Div 13: buy tickets Div 18: About usThe Pittsburgh Taco Festivalis an annual food festival aimed at celebrating (and eating) TACOS, as well as supporting and raising funds and awareness for the citys Latin-American community.

For restaurants that do not offer online reservations, call to inquire about a dining time. MENTION RESTAURANT WEEK.When being seated and offered menus, ensure to mention Pittsburgh Restaurant Week to the waitstaff to ensure you are getting the correct menus and pricing. GRATUITIES APPRECIATED.Waitstaff handle a surge of customers during restaurant week and many of the special menus are multiple courses that would have been priced higher if ordered a la carte. If you are able, consider gratuities that take into account the original pricing and extra effort to perfect a multi-course service.

    "https://bananasplitfest.com/history/": "History The story of the All-American dessert that started in Latrobe Since its invention in 1904, the Banana Split has become an iconic part of American dessert culture. Its history began when David Strickler, a 23-year-old soda jerk at a drugstore in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, started experimenting with different ice cream combinations. He cut a banana lengthwise, added three scoops of ice cream  typically vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry  and then topped it with sweet syrups, marshmallow, chopped nuts, whipped cream, and a maraschino cherry. It was an instant hit! The Banana Split quickly gained popularity, particularly among the students at nearby St. Vincent College, who would frequent the drugstore to indulge in the delicious dessert. Stricklers banana-based sundaes quickly became known as Dr. Daves among the students, who would rave about them to their hometown soda jerks, spreading the word about the new dessert. Within a few years, the Banana Split gained national recognition. The dessert had become a staple of American dessert culture, and Strickler had become a pioneer of the ice cream industry. Strickler went on to buy the Latrobe pharmacy where he had invented the Banana Split, and he even added an optical business upstairs. He was a staple in the local community until he passed away in 1971 at the age of 90. In 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the Banana Split, Ice-Cream Joe Gruble worked with the University of Pitt to commemorate Stricklers invention with the From Pitt Came the Split Event. The Great American Banana Split Festival has been a staple in Latrobe since 2013, when the Pennsylvania Historical Society unveiled a marker at the former site of Tassels Pharmacy where Sticker was working at the time of his invention, cementing Stricklers legacy in historical record. Today, the Banana Split remains a beloved dessert across the United States and is often found on the menus of ice cream shops and restaurants. It is also the official dessert of Pennsylvania! David Strickler Inside Stricklers Drug Store Outside Stricklers Drug Store Photos courtesy of the Latrobe Historical Society Honorary Chair Ice Cream Joe Gruble The legacy of Latrobe as the birthplace of the banana split might not have been fully realized except for the efforts of Ice Cream Joe. While locals knew of the towns claim to the dessert, it was Joe who in 2004, on the 100th anniversary of the invention, worked with the University of Pittsburgh on the From Pitt Came the Split event. He was also part of the group of Latrobeans that submitted the petition for the Pennsylvania Historical Marker that was installed in 2013. From 2015 until his passing in 2017, Joe served up ice cream, ideas, and smiles as the celebrations honorary chair."
