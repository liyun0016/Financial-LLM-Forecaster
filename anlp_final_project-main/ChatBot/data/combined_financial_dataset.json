{"input":"How safe is a checking account?","output":"In the case of bank failures You are protected by FDIC insurance.  At the time I wrote this, you are insured up to $250,000.  In my lifetime, it has been as high as $1,000,000 and as low as $100,000.  I attached a link, which is updated by FDIC. In the case of fraud It depends. If you read this story and are horrified (I was too), you know that the banking system is not as safe as the other answers imply: In February 2005, Joe Lopez, a businessman from Florida, filed a suit   against Bank of America after unknown hackers stole $90,000 from his   Bank of America account. The money had been transferred to Latvia. An investigation showed that Mr. Lopez\u2019s computer was infected with a   malicious program, Backdoor.Coreflood, which records every keystroke   and sends this information to malicious users via the Internet. This   is how the hackers got hold of Joe Lopez\u2019s user name and password,   since Mr. Lopez often used the Internet to manage his Bank of America   account. However the court did not rule in favor of the plaintiff, saying that   Mr. Lopez had neglected to take basic precautions when managing his   bank account on the Internet: a signature for the malicious code that   was found on his system had been added to nearly all antivirus product   databases back in 2003. Ouch.   But let's think about the story for a second - he had his money stolen because of online banking and he didn't have the latest antivirus\/antimalware software.  How safe is banking if you don't do online banking?  In the case of this story, it would have prevented keyloggers, but you're still susceptible to someone stealing your card or account information.  So: In the bank's defense, how does a bank not know that someone didn't wire money to a friend (which is a loss for good), then get some of that money back from his friend while also getting money back from the bank, which had to face the loss.  Yes, it sucks, but it's not total madness. As for disputing charges, from personal experience it also depends.  I don't use cards whatsoever, so I've never had to worry, but both of my parents have experienced banking fraud where a fake charge on their card was not reversed.  Neither of my parents are rich and can't afford lawyers, so crying \"lawsuit\" is not an option for everyone.  How often does this occur?  I suspect it's rare that banks don't reverse the charges in fraudulent cases, though you will still lose time for filing and possibly filling out paperwork.  The way to prevent this: As much as I hate to be the bearer of bad news, there is no absolutely safe place to keep your money.  Even if you bought metals and buried them in the ground, a drifter with a metal detector might run across it one day.  You can take steps to protect yourself, but there is no absolute guarantee that these will work out. Account Closures I added this today because I saw this question and have only seen\/heard about this three times.  Provided that you get the cashier's check back safely, you should be okay - but why was this person's account closed and look at how much funds he had!  From his question: In the two years I banked with BoA I never had an overdraft or any   negative marks on my account so the only thing that would stick out   was a check that I deposited for $26k that my mom left me after she   passed. Naturally, people aren't going to like some of my answers, especially this, but imagine you're in an immediate need for cash, and you experience this issue.  What can you do?

{"input":"Why is being \u201cupside down\u201d on a mortgage so bad?","output":"tl;dr: when everything is going great, it's not really a problem. It's when things change that it's a problem. Finally, home loans are extended over extremely long periods (i.e. 15 or 30 years), making any fluctuations in their value short-lived - even less reason to be obsessed over their current value relative to the loan. Your post is based on the assumption that you never move. In that case, you are correct - being underwater on a mortgage is not a problem. The market value of your house matters little, except if you sell it or it gets reassessed. The primary problem arises if you want to sell. There are a variety of reasons you might be required to move: In all of these scenarios it is a major problem if you cannot sell. Your options generally are: In the first option, you will destroy your credit. This may or may not be a problem. The second is a major inconvenience. The third is ideal, but often people in this situation have money related problems. Student loans can deferred if needed. Mortgages cannot. A car is more likely to be a lower payment as well as a lower amount underwater. Generally, the problem comes when people buy a mortgage assuming certain things - whether that's appreciation, income stability\/growth, etc. When these change they run into these problems and that is exactly a moment where being underwater is a problem.","instruction":"Offer your thoughts or opinion on the input financial query or topic using your financial background."}

{"input":"Given a certain yearly savings, how much can I spend on a capital improvement? NPV of future cash flow","output":"For this, the internal rate of return is preferred. In short, all cash flows need to be discounted to the present and set equal to 0 so that an implied rate of return can be calculated. You could try to work this out by hand, but it's practically hopeless because of solving for roots of the implied rate of return which are most likely complex. It's better to use a spreadsheet with this capability such as OpenOffice's Calc. The average return on equity is 9%, so anything higher than that is a rational choice. Example Using this simple tool, the formula variables can easily be input. For instance, the first year has a presumed cash inflow of $2,460 because the insurance has a 30% discount from $8,200 that is assumed to be otherwise paid, a cash inflow of $40,000 to finance the sprinklers, a cash outflow of $40,000 to fund the sprinklers, a $400 outflow for inspection, and an outflow in the amount of the first year's interest on the loan.

{"input":"A guy scammed me, but he gave me a bank account number & routing number. Can I use that to take out what he owes me?","output":"You're not focusing in the right place and neither is anyone else on this thread because this isn't about the guy owning you money... This is about you not having enough money to pay your rent.  If rent wasn't due and the utility bills weren't piling up, you wouldn't be trying to justify taking money out of someone else's account. So let's triage this. Your #1 problem isn't hunting down Dr. Deadbeat's wallet. So put a pin in that for now and get to the real deal.  Getting rent paid. Right? OK, you said he called \"regarding a business I have\".  It's great that you have your own business.  Are you also employed elsewhere?  If you are, then you really should simply go to your employer and tell them you are in financial distress.  Tell them that right now you can't cover your rent or bills and you want to know if they can help, i.e. give you an advance from your paycheck, do a withdrawal\/loan from a retirement savings that's in your employee benefits package, etc...  They will HELP YOU because it's in their best interest as much as it is in yours. Foregoing that, consider these thoughts... If you were to go your grandparents telling them what you told all of us here, and ask them the same \"do you think it's ok to...\", they would say something close to \"Absolutely DO NOT touch someone else bank account EVER! It doesn't matter what information you have, how you got it, or what you think they owe you. Do NOT touch it.  There's a legal system that will help you get it from them if they truly do owe it to you.\"   I guarantee you this, withdrawing funds from an account on which you are NOT an authorized signatory is both financial theft as well as identity theft. Bonus if you do it on a computer, because you'd then be facing criminal charges that go beyond your specific legal district, i.e. you'd face criminal charges on a national level. If convicted, odds are you'd be sentenced within the penal guidelines of the Netherlands 1983 Financial Penalties Act (FPA). Ergo, you would have much much much less money in the very near future, which would feel like an eternal walk through the Hell of the court system.  Ultimately, over your lifetime you would be exponentially poorer than you may think you are now.  I strongly urge you to rebrand this \"financial loss\" as \"Tuition at the School of Hard Knocks\". There's one last thing... the train jumps the tracks for me during your story... This guy called you? Right?...  (raised eyebrow) What kind of business do you \"have\"?  The sense of desperation and naivet\u00e9 in your urgent need for money to pay rent. The fact that you are accepting payment for services by conducting a  bank transfer specifically from your clients account directly toward your own utility bills is a big red flag. Bypassing business accounting and using revenue for personal finances isn't legitimate business practices. Plus you are doing it by using the bank information of brand new client who is a TOTAL stranger.  Now consider fact that this total stranger was so exceedingly generous to someone from whom he wanted personal services to be rendered. Those all tell me that he's doing something he wants the other person to do for him and he doesn't want anyone else to know.  The fact that he's being so benevolent like a 'sugar daddy' tells me that he feels guilty for having someone do what he's asking them to do.  Perceived financial superiority is the smoothest of smooth power tools that predators and abusers have in their bag.  For instance, an outlandish financial promise is probably the easiest way to target someone who is vulnerable; and then seduce them into being their victim.  Redirecting your focus on how much better life will be once your problem is solved by this cash rather than focusing on the fact that they're taking advantage of you.  Offering to pay rates that are dramatically excessive is a way of buying a clean conscious, because he's doing something that will \"rescue you\" from a crisis. The final nail in the coffin for me was that he left so abruptly and your implied instinct suggesting his reason was a lie.  It sounds like he got scared or ashamed of his actions and ran out.

{"input":"Why is it possible to just take out a ton of credit cards, max them out and default in 7 years?","output":"Well, primarily because that's fraud and fraud prevents a debtor from receiving a discharge in bankruptcy court.  Fraud would be pretty easy to prove if you didn't have an income change and you have several lines of credit opened on and around the same day with almost no payments made toward them.  Additionally, thanks to the reforms of the bankruptcy code, if your income exceeds the median income of your state you'll be forced in to a Chapter 13 and committed to a repayment plan that allocates all of your \"disposable income\" to your creditors. Now if whoever posted that will attempt to simply not pay then negotiate repayment plans with their creditors the process will last far longer than 7 years.  It takes a long time to be in default for enough time that a consumer creditor will negotiate the debt and this is assuming the creditor doesn't sue you and get a judgement which could apply liens to any property you may own.  The judgment(s) will likely cause you to pursue bankruptcy anyway; only now you're at least a few years beyond the point at which you ruined your credit.","instruction":"Offer your insights or judgment on the input financial query or topic using your financial expertise.

{"input":"Can I profit from anticipating a drop in value?","output":"Purchasing an option to sell the stock is probably the safest bet. This gives you reasonable leverage, and your risk is limited to the cost of the option. Say the stock currently sells for $100 per share. You think it will drop to $80 per share in the next two weeks and the market thinks the price will be stable. Now, consider an option to sell one share of that stock for $95 any time within the next two weeks. The market would consider that option nearly worthless, since in all likelihood, you would lose out by exercising it (since you could just sell the share on the market for a price expected to be higher than that). You might be able to acquire that option for $5. Now, say you're right and within two weeks, the price drops to $80. Now you can purchase a share for $80, exercise the option to sell it for $95, and pocket $15. That would make you a $10 profit on a $5 investment. If you're wrong, you just let the option lapse and are out $5. No problem. In reality, you would buy a number of such options. And you wouldn't actually buy a share and exercise the option, you would just sell the option back to its issuer for $15.","instruction":"Utilize your financial knowledge, give your answer or opinion to the input question or subject .

JB King makes a good point that for most people the two stocks you mentioned would both be considered value right now as they are both stable companies with a significant dividend.  You are correct though Pfizer might be considered \"more growth.\" A more drastic example would be the difference between Target and Amazon.  Both are retail companies that sell a wide variety of products.  Target is a value company: a established company with stable revenues that uses its income to give a fairly stable dividend.  Amazon is a growth company: that is reinvesting its revenues back into the corporation to grow itself as fast as possible.   The price of the Amazon stock reflects what people think will be future growth (future income) for the company.  Whereas Target's price appears to be based on the idea that future income will be similar to current income.  You can see why growth companies like Amazon might be more risky as that growth you paid a high price for may not be realized, but the payout may be much higher as well.","instruction":"Share your insights or perspective on the financial matter presented in the input."}

{"input":"Switching Roth IRA ( from American Funds to Vanguard)","output":"You can have as many IRA accounts as you want (whether Roth or Traditional), so you can have a Roth IRA with American Funds and another Roth IRA with Vanguard if you like. One disadvantage of  having too many IRA accounts with small balances in each is that most custodians  (including Vanguard) charge an annual fee for maintaining IRA accounts with small balances but waive the fee if the balance is large. So it is best to keep your Roth IRA in just one or two funds with just one or two custodians until such time as investment returns plus additional contributions made over the years makes the balances large enough to diversify further. Remember also that you cannot contribute the maximum to each IRA; the sum total of all your IRA contributions (doesn't matter whether to Roth or to Traditional IRAs) for any year must satisfy the limit for that year. You can move money from one IRA of yours to another IRA (of the same type) of yours without any tax issues to worry about. Such movements (called rollovers or transfers) are  not contributions and do not count towards the annual contribution limit. The easiest way to do move money from one IRA account to another IRA account is by a trustee-to-trustee transfer where the money goes directly from one custodian (American Funds in this case) to the other custodian (Vanguard in this case). The easiest way of accomplishing this is to call Vanguard or go online on their website, tell them that you are wanting to  establish a Roth IRA with them, and that you want to fund it by transferring money held in a Roth IRA with American Funds. Give Vanguard the account  number of your existing American Funds IRA, tell them how much  you want to transfer over -- $1000 or $20,000 or the entire balance as the case may be -- and tell Vanguard to go get the money.  In a few days' time, the money will appear in your new Vanguard Roth IRA and the American Funds Roth IRA will have a smaller balance, possibly a zero balance, or might even be closed if you told Vanguard to collect the entire balance.  DO NOT approach American Funds and tell them that you want to transfer money to a new Roth IRA with Vanguard: they will bitch and moan and drag their heels about doing so because  they are unhappy to lose your business, and will probably screw up the transfer. Talk to Vanguard only. They are eager to get their hands on your IRA money and will gladly take care of the whole thing for you at no charge to you. DO NOT cash in any stock shares, or mutual fund shares, or whatever is in your Roth IRA in preparation for \"cashing out of the old account\". There is a method where you take a \"rollover distribution\" from your American Funds Roth IRA and then deposit the money into your new Vanguard Roth IRA within 60 days, but I recommend most strongly against using this because too many people manage to screw it up. It is 60 days, not two months; the clock starts from the day American Funds cuts your check, not when you get the check, and it is stopped when the money gets deposited into your new account, not the day you mailed the check to Vanguard or the day that Vanguard received it,  and so on. In short, DO NOT try this at home:  stick to a trustee-to-trustee transfer and avoid the hassles.","instruction":"Based on your financial expertise, provide your response or viewpoint on the given financial question or topic.

For example, take the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB). iShares publishes the complete list of the fund's holdings on their website. This information isn't always easy to find or available, but it's a place to start. For some index funds, you should just be able to look up the index the fund is trying to match. This won't be perfect (take Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF (VOO); the fund holds 503 stocks, while the S&P 500 index is comprised of exactly 500), but once again, it's a place to start. A few more points to keep in mind. Remember that many ETF's, including equity ETF's, will hold a small portion of their assets in cash or cash-equivalent instruments to assist with rebalancing. For index funds, this may not be reflected in the index itself, and it may not show up in the list of holdings. VOO is an example of this. However, that information is usually available in the fund's prospectus or the fund's site. Also, I doubt that many stock ETF's, at least index funds, change their asset allocations all that frequently.

{"input":"How can I compare the risk of different investing opportunities?","output":"First of all, setting some basics: What is a sound way to measure the risk of each investment in order to compare them with each other ? There is no single way that can be used across all asset classes \/ risks. Generally speaking, you want to perform both a quantitative and qualitative assessment of risks that you identify.  Quantitative risk assessment may involve historical data and\/or parametric or non-parametric models. Using historical data is often simple but may be hard in cases where the amount of data you have on a given event is low (e.g. risk of bust by investing in a cryptocurrency). Parametric and non-parametric risk quantification models exist (e.g. Value at Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES), etc) and abound but a lot of them are more complicated than necessary for an individual's requirements. Qualitative risk assessment is \"simply\" assessing the likelihood and severity of risks by using intuition, expert judgment (where that applies), etc. One may consult with outside parties (e.g. lawyers, accountants, bankers, etc) where their advisory may help highlighting some risks or understanding them better. To ease comparing investment opportunities, you may want to perform a risk assessment on categories of risks (e.g. investing in the stock market vs bond market). To compare between those categories, one should look at the whole picture (quantitative and qualitative) with their risk appetite in mind. Of course, after taking those macro decisions, you would need to further assess risks on more micro decisions (e.g. Microsoft or Google ?). You would then most likely end up with better comparatives as you would be comparing items similar in nature. Should I always consider the worst case scenario ? Because when I do that, I always can lose everything. Generally speaking, you want to consider everything so that you can perform a risk assessment and decide on your risk mitigating strategy (see Q4). By assessing the likelihood and severity of risks you may find that even in cases where you are comparatively as worse-off (e.g. in case of complete bust), the likelihood may differ. For example, keeping gold in a personal stash at home vs your employer going bankrupt if you are working for a large firm. Do note that you want to compare risks (both likelihood and severity) after any risk mitigation strategy you may want to put in place (e.g. maybe putting your gold in a safety box in a secure bank would make the likelihood of losing your gold essentially null). Is there a way to estimate the probability of such events, better than intuition ? Estimating probability or likelihood is largely dependent on data on hand and your capacity to model events. For most practical purposes of an individual, modelling would be way off in terms of reward-benefits. You may therefore want to simply research on past events and assign them a 1-5 (1 being very low, 5 being very high) risk rating based on your assessment of the likelihood. For example, you may assign a 1 on your employer going bankrupt and a 2 or 3 on being burglarized. This is only slightly better than intuition but has the merit of being based on data (e.g. frequency of burglary in your neighborhood). Should I only consider more probable outcomes and have a plan for them if they occur? This depends largely on your risk appetite. The more risk averse you are, the more thorough you will want to be in identifying, tracking and mitigating risks. For the risks that you have identified as relevant, or of concern, you may opt to establish a risk mitigating strategy, which is conventionally one of accepting, sharing (by taking insurance, for example), avoiding and reducing. It may not be possible to share or reduce some risks, especially for individuals, and so often the response will be either to accept or avoid the given risks by opting in or out on an opportunity.","instruction":"Offer your insights or judgment on the input financial query or topic using your financial expertise.

{"input":"Should I Purchase Health Insurance Through My S-Corp","output":"The answer seems to depend on where you live.  Perhaps you already found this, but the summary from the IRS is: The insurance laws in some states do not allow a corporation to purchase group health insurance when the corporation only has one employee. Therefore, if the shareholder was the sole corporate employee, the shareholder had to purchase his health insurance in his own name. The IRS issued Notice 2008-1, which ruled that under certain situations the shareholder would be allowed an above-the-line deduction even if the health insurance policy was purchased in the name of the shareholder. Notice 2008-1 provided four examples, including three examples in which the shareholder purchased the health insurance and one in which the S corporation purchased the health insurance. Notice 2008-1 states that if the shareholder purchased the health insurance in his own name and paid for it with his own funds, the shareholder would not be allowed an above-the-line deduction. On the other hand, if the shareholder purchased the health insurance in his own name but the S corporation either directly paid for the health insurance or reimbursed the shareholder for the health insurance and also included the premium payment in the shareholder\u2019s W-2, the shareholder would be allowed an above-the-line deduction. The bottom line is that in order for a shareholder to claim an above-the-line deduction, the health insurance premiums must ultimately be paid by the S corporation and must be reported as taxable compensation in the shareholder\u2019s W-2. https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/Businesses\/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed\/S-Corporation-Compensation-and-Medical-Insurance-Issues I understand this to mean that you can only get the deduction in your case (having purchased it in your own name) if your state does not allow your S-Corp to purchase a group health plan because you only have one employee. (I don't know specifically if Illinois fits that description or not.)  In addition, there are rules about reporting health insurance premiums for taxes for S-Corp share members that you should also check.  Personally, I think that it's complicated enough that advice from a CPA or other tax advisor specific to your situation would be worth the cost.","instruction":"Based on your financial expertise, provide your response or viewpoint on the given financial question or topic.

{"input":"Is it normal to think of money in different \u201ccontexts\u201d?","output":"Here's how I think about money. There are only 3 categories \/ contexts (buckets) that my earned money falls into. Savings is my emergency fund. I keep 6 months of total expenses (expenses are anything in the consumption bucket). You can be as detailed as you want with this area but I tend to leave a fudge factor. In other words, if I estimate that I spend approximately $3,000 a month in consumption dollars then I'll save $3,500 times 6 in the bank. This money needs to be liquid. Some people use a HELOC, other people use their ROTH contributions. In any case, you need to put this money some place you can get access to it in case you go from accumulation (income exceed expenses) to decumulation mode (expenses exceed income). This money is distinct from consumption which I will cover in paragraph three. Investments are stocks, bonds, income producing real estate, small businesses, etc. These dollars require a strategy. The strategy can include some form of asset allocation but more importantly a timeline. These are the dollars that are working for you. Each dollar placed here will multiply over time. Once you put a dollar here it shouldn't be taken out unless there is some sort of catastrophe that your savings can't handle or your timeline has been achieved. Notice that rental real estate is included so liquidating stocks to purchase rental real estate is NOT considered removing investment dollars. Just reallocating based on your asset allocation. This bucket includes 401k's, IRAs, all tax-sheltered accounts, non-sheltered brokerage accounts, and rental real estate. In general your primary residence is not included in this bucket. Some people include the equity of their primary residence in the investment column but it can complicate the equation and I prefer to leave it out. The consumption bucket is the most important bucket and the one you spend the most time with. It requires a budget. This includes your $5 magazine and your $200 bottle of wine. Anything in this bucket is gone. You can recover a portion of it by selling it on ebay for $3 (these are earned dollars) but the original $5 is still considered spent. The reason your thought process in this area is distinct from the other two, the decisions made in this area will have the biggest impact on your personal finances. Warren Buffett was famous for skimping on haircuts because they are worth thousands of dollars down the road if they are invested instead. Remember this is a zero-sum game so every $1 not consumed is placed in one of the other buckets. Once your savings bucket is full every dollar not consumed is sent to investments. Remember to include everything that does not fit in the other two buckets. Most people forget their car insurance, life insurance, tax bill at the end of the year, accountant bill, etc. In conclusion, there are three buckets. Savings, which serve as your emergency bucket. This money should not be touched unless you switch from accumulation to decumulation. Investments, which are your dollars that are working for you over time. They require a strategy and a timeline. Consumption, which are your monthly expenses. These dollars keep you alive and contribute to your enjoyment. This is a short explanation of my use of money. It can get as complicated and detailed as you want it to be but as long as you tag your dollars correctly you'll be okay IMHO. HTH.","instruction":"Offer your thoughts or opinion on the input financial query or topic using your financial background."}

{"input":"Should I exclude bonds from our retirement investment portfolio if our time horizon is still long enough?","output":"I've had the same thoughts recently and after reading Investing at Level 3 by James Cloonan I believe his thesis that for the passive investor you're giving up too much if you're not 100% in equities. He is clear to point out that you need to be well aware of your withdrawal horizons and has specific tactics for shifting the portfolio when you know you must have the money in the next five years and wouldn't want to pull money out when you're at a market low. The kicker for me was shifting your thought to a plotting a straight line of reasonable expectations on your return. Then you don't worry about how far down you are from your high (or up from your low) but you measure yourself against the expected return and you'll find some real grounding. You're investing for the long term so you're going to see 2-3 bear markets. That isn't the the time to get cold feet and react. Stay put and it will come back. The market gets back to the reasonable expectations very quickly as he confirms in all the bear markets and recessions of any note. He gives guidelines for a passive investing strategy to leverage this mentality and talks about venturing into an active strategy but doesn't go into great depth. So if you're looking to invest more passively this book may be enough to get you rolling with thinking differently than the traditional 70\/30 split.","instruction":"Offer your insights or judgment on the input financial query or topic using your financial expertise.

{"input":"Which technical analysis indicators are considered leading stock market indicators?","output":"Relative Strength Indicators are also trailing indicators.  They are based on the number of recent upticks or downticks in an investment's price.  (The size of a tick is quantized, and related to the investment's price.)  By the time enough upticks have accumulated to generate a buy signal, the investment has already increased in price significantly.  Similarly, by the time enough downticks have accumulated a to generate a sell signal, the investment has already dropped in price significantly. The theory of Relative Strength Indicators is based on the hope that moves found by these indicators are likely to continue after the signal is generated.  But even if this is the case, someone who relies on these indicators will miss out on the first part of the move. Dorsey-Wright offers investment research based on the theory of Relative Strength Indicators.  They offer investment vehicles based on this research.

{"input":"Would I qualify for a USDA loan?","output":"How realistic is it that I will be able to get a home within the 250,000 range in the next year or so?  Very unlikely in the next year.  The debt\/income ratio isn't good enough, and your credit score needs to show at least a year of regular payments without late or default issues before you can start asking for mortgages in this range. You don't mention how long you've been employed at these incomes, this can also count against you if you haven't both been employed for a full year at these incomes. They will look even more unfavorably on the employment situation if they aren't both full time jobs, although if you have a full year's worth of paychecks showing the income is regular then that might mitigate the full time\/part time issue. next year or so? If you pay down your high interest debt (car, credit cards), and maintain employment (keep your check stubs and tax returns, the loan officer will want copies), then there's a slight chance. And, from this quick snap shot of our finances, does it look like we would be able to qualify for a USDA loan? Probably not.  Mostly for the same reasons - the only time a USDA loan helps is when you would be able to get a regular loan if you had the down payment. Even with an available down payment of 50k, you wouldn't be able to get a regular loan, therefore it's unlikely that you'd qualify for a USDA loan. If you are anxious to get into a house, choose something much smaller, in the 100k-150k range. It would improve your debt\/loan ratio enough that you might then qualify for a USDA loan.  However, I think you'd still have issues if you haven't both been employed at this rate of income for at least a year, and have made regular payments on all your debts for at least a year. I'll echo what others have suggested, though, strengthen your credit, eliminate as much of your high interest debt as you can (car, credit cards), and keep your jobs for a year or two.  Start a savings plan so you can contribute a small down payment - at least 3-5% of the desired home price - when you are in a better position to buy. During this time keep track of your paycheck stubs, you may need them to prove income over the time period your loan officer will request. Note that even with a USDA loan you still have to pay closing costs, and those can run several thousand dollars, so don't expect to be able to come to the table with no cash. Lastly, there's good reason to be very conservative regarding house cost and size.  If you can, consider buying the house as if you only had the 46k per year.  Move the debt to the person making the lower income, and if you buy the house in the name of the person only making 46k per year, then the debt\/loan ratio looks very positive.  Further it may be that the credit history of that person is better, and the employment history is better.  If one of you has better history in these ways, then you might have a better chance if only one of you buys the house.  Banks can't tell you about this, but it does work.  Keep in mind, though, that if you two part ways it could be very unhappy since one would be left with all the debt and the house would be in the other's name.  Not a great situation to be in, so make sure that you both carefully consider the risks associated with the decisions made.","instruction":"Offer your insights or judgment on the input financial query or topic using your financial expertise.

{"input":"Can a retail trader do bid-ask spread scalping through algo-trading?","output":"In US public stock markets there is no difference between the actions individual retail traders are \"permitted\" to take and the actions institutional\/corporate traders are \"permitted\" to take.  The only difference is the cost of those actions.  For example, if you become a Registered Market Maker on, say, the BATS stock exchange, you'll get some amazing rebates and reduced transaction prices; however, in order to qualify for Registered Market Maker status you have to maintain constant orders in the book for hundreds of equities at significant volumes.  An individual retail trader is certainly permitted to do that, but it's probably too expensive. Algorithmic trading is not the same as automated trading (algorithmic trading can be non-automated, and automated trading can be non-algorithmic), and both can be anywhere from low- to high-frequency.  A low-frequency automated strategy is essentially indistinguishable from a person clicking their mouse several times per day, so: no, from a legal or regulatory perspective there is no special procedure an individual retail trader has to follow before s\/he can automate a trading strategy.  (Your broker, on the other hand, may have all sorts of hoops for you to jump through in order to use their automation platform.) Last (but certainly not least) you will almost certainly lose money hand over fist attempting bid-ask scalping as an individual retail trader, whether your approach is algorithmic or not, automated or not.  Why?  Because the only way to succeed at bid-ask scalping is to (a) always be at\/near the front of the queue when a price change occurs in your favor, and (b) always cancel your resting orders before they are executed when a price change occurs against you.  Unless your algorithms are smarter than every other algorithm in the industry, an individual retail trader operating through a broker's trading platform cannot react quickly enough to succeed at either of those.  You would have to eschew the broker and buy direct market access to even have a chance, and that's the point at which you're no longer a retail trader.

{"input":"What are the advantages of paying off a mortgage quickly?","output":"The financial reasons, beyond simply owning your home outright, are: You're no longer paying interest. Yes, the interest is tax-deductible in the U.S. (though not in Canada), but the tax savings is a percentage of a percentage; if you paid, say, $8000 in interest last year, at the 25% marginal rate you effectively save $2000 off your taxes. But, if you paid off your home and had that $8000 in your pocket, you'd pay the $2000 in taxes but you'd have $6000 left over. Which is the better deal? In Canada, the decision gets even easier; you pay taxes on the interest money either way, so you're either spending the $8000 in interest, lost forever as cost of capital, or on other things. Whatever you're earning is going into your own pocket, not the bank's. Similar to the interest, but also including principal, a home you own outright is a mortgage payment you don't have to make. You can now use that money, principal and interest, for other things. Whether these advantages outweigh those of anything else you could do with a few hundred grand depends primarily on the rate of return. If you got in at the bottom of the mortgage crisis (which is pretty much right now) and got a rate in the 3-4% range, with no MIP or other payment on top, then almost anything you can do with the amount you'd need to pay off a mortgage principal would get you a better rate of return. However, you'll need some market savvy to avoid risks.  In most cases when someone has pretty much any debt and a big wad of cash they're considering how to spend, I usually recommend paying off the debt, because that is, in effect, a risk-free way to increase the net rate of return on your total wealth and income. Balancing debt with investments always carries with it the risk that the investment will fail, leaving you stuck with the debt. Paying the debt on the other hand will guarantee that you don't have to pay interest on that outstanding amount anymore, so it's no longer offsetting whatever gains you are making in the market on your savings or future investments.","instruction":"Offer your thoughts or opinion on the input financial query or topic using your financial background."}

You have essentially two options: Stop making payments for him.  If he does not make them, the car will be repossessed and the default will appear on both his and your credit.  You will have a credit ding to live with, but he will to and he won't have the car. Continue to make payments if he does not, to preserve your credit, and sue him for the money you have paid.  In your suit you could request repayment of the money or have him sign over the title (ownership) to you, if you would be happy with either option.  I suspect that he will object to both, so the judge is going to have to decide if he finds your case has merit. If you go with option 1 and he picks up the payments so the car isn't repossessed, you can then still take option 2 to recover the money you have paid.

You sell it for any price you like, and you don't add VAT.  Let's say you set the price at \u00a315 and sell 1000 items for \u00a315. You take \u00a315,000, you spent \u00a312,000, you make \u00a33,000 profit in your pocket and you'll pay taxes according to your profits (\u00a33,000). It doesn't really matter that VAT was involved, it just affects the price that you pay.  If you mostly trade with private customers and not with companies, being not VAT registered is a good idea, since by not having to add VAT you can keep your prices lower. It's different if you trade mostly with VAT-registered companies. In that example, if private customers are willing to pay \u00a315 but not more, if you were VAT registered, you couldn't just charge \u00a315 + VAT = \u00a318, because your customers would stop buying. So you'd have to charge \u00a312.50 + VAT = \u00a315 and make less money.  But if you sell to a company, it doesn't make a difference to them if they pay \u00a315 without VAT or \u00a315 + VAT = \u00a318. You have to send the VAT to HMRC, but you can subtract the \u00a32,000 that you paid yourself, so you make \u00a32,000 more profit.","instruction":"Offer your insights or judgment on the input financial query or topic using your financial expertise.

If they have a billing address in California, and a shipping address in Nevada, and the goods are shipping to Nevada, you do not have to declare tax. If you have a mixture of tangible (computer, mouse, keyboard) and intangible assets (warranty) in a cart, and the shipping address is in California, you charge tax on the tangible assets, but NOT on the intangible assets. Yes, you can charge tax on the whole order.  Yes for most businesses that's \"Good enough\", but I'm not trying to provide the \"good enough\" solution, I'm simply telling you how very large businesses run and operate.  As I've mentioned, I've done several tax integrations using software called Sabrix (Google if you've not heard of it), and have done those integrations for companies like the BBC and Corbis (owned and operated by Bill Gates). Take it or leave it, but the correct way to charge taxes, especially given the complex tax laws of the US and internationally, is to charge per item.  If you just need the \"good enough\" approach, feel free to calculate it by total. Some additional reading: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Taxation_of_Digital_Goods Another possible federal limitation on Internet taxation is the United States Supreme Court case, Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298 (1992),[6] which held that under the dormant commerce clause, goods purchased through mail order cannot be subject to a state\u2019s sales tax unless the vendor has a substantial nexus with the state levying the tax.  In 1997, the federal government decided to limit taxation of Internet activity for a period of time. The Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) prohibits taxes on Internet access, which is defined as a service that allows users access to content, information, email or other services offered over the Internet and may include access to proprietary content, information, and other services as part of a package offered to customers. The Act has exceptions for taxes levied before the statute was written and for sales taxes on online purchases of physical goods.","instruction":"Offer your thoughts or opinion on the input financial query or topic using your financial background."}
{"input":"How does Robinhood stock broker make money?","output":"Robinhood seems interesting. Some say it's a gimmicky site with a nice UI not an investing or trading platform. From investopedia: 1. For now, the app stays afloat for mainly two reasons. First, the business itself is extremely lean: no physical locations, a small   staff, no massive public relations campaigns and only one operating   system platform to maintain. Robinhood also generates interest off of   unused cash deposits from user accounts according to the Federal Funds   rate. 2. Second, venture capitalists such as Index Ventures, Ribbit Capital,   Google Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Social Leverage,and \u201cmany   others\u201d have invested more than $16 million in the app. 3. According to Barron\u2019s, Robinhood plans to implement margin trading in   2015, eventually charging 3.5% interest for the service. E*Trade   charges 8.44% for accounts under $25,000. Phone assisted trading will   also be available at $10 per trade in the future. 4. Originally, Robinhood planned to make money off of order flows \u2013 a   common tactic used by discount brokerages in the 199\ufeff0s to generate   revenue. According to the company's FAQ, Robinhood backpedaled on the   idea because it executes orders through a clearing partner and, as a   result, receives little to no payment for order flow. The company is   willing to return to its original plan in the future if it receives   order flows directly or begins to generate a lot of revenue from them.","instruction":"Offer your thoughts or opinion on the input financial query or topic using your financial background."}
{"input":"Does the rise in ACA premiums affect employer-provided health insurance premiums?","output":"It's likely impossible to determine why premiums are increasing in a meaningful way; not only is the interrelationship between the various data points very complex, but some of the increases are likely due to decisions by people who do not and will not publicly post what they decided and why. However, it is possible to compare health insurance premium increases over time to see if the increases in employer-sponsored health insurance premiums are comparable or not to the pre-ACA timeframe. Since the ACA phased in over a few years, we can compare the period 2008-2010 \"pre-ACA\" and 2013-2015 \"post-ACA\", ignoring 2011-2012 as being unclearly affected by the ACA phase-in.  For this, I will look at single coverage premiums only for the purpose of simplifying the analysis. I found a good table of 2008-2010 premiums from the NCSL; they list the following: Kaiser Permanente had a good list for 2013-2015 here: From 2008-2010, the average growth was around 6% per year.  From 2013-2015, the growth averaged about 3%.  In both of these cases we are comparing total premiums (sum of employer and employee contributions). So, from a data-driven look, it seems that the premium growth is lower post-ACA than pre-ACA, so it's unlikely that the ACA could be accused of causing increased premium growth.  Of course, this is US-wide average, and on a state-by-state basis there may well be significant differences that may or may not be related to the ACA. One thing that is covered on the NCSL page linked above that is interesting: while the premium growth has slowed significantly (about 50% of the growth pre-ACA), health insurance premiums are a higher proportion of employee's wages, and that growth is continuing - because wage growth has not kept pace with inflation post-2008 recession.  Employee contributions also may be higher post-recession; many companies reduced their contribution percentage (as my then employer did, for example).   Finally, increases in the ACA plans are also commonly overstated.  They largely are in line with employer plans or even less.   In 2015, premiums were basically flat, decreasing slightly in fact - see the KFF analysis here.  2016 saw a 3.6% by this methodology (see the 2016 analysis).   It's very easy to cherrypick examples that are favorable to any interpretation from the data, though; there are such big swings as a result of the different conditions in the marketplaces that it's easy to pick a few that have high swings and claim the ACA has massive premium increases, or pick a few that have low swings and claim it's reducing costs.","instruction":"Utilize your financial knowledge, give your answer or opinion to the input question or subject .

So I'll take a stab at this, comment if it doesn't make sense to you. To answer the question in the title, you invest in an IRA because you want to save money to allow you to retire. The government provides you with tax incentives that make an IRA an excellent vehicle to do this. The rules regarding IRA tax treatment provide disincentives, through tax penalties, for withdrawing money before retirement. This topic is covered dozens of times, so search around for more detail. Regarding your desire to invest in items with high \"intrinsic\" value, I would argue that gold and silver are not good vehicles for doing this. Intrinsic value doesn't mean what you want it to mean in this context -- gold and silver are commodities, whose prices fluctuate dramatically.  If you want to grow money for retirement over a long period, of time, you should be invested in diversified collection of investments, and precious metals should be a relatively small part of your portfolio.","instruction":"Offer your thoughts or opinion on the input financial query or topic using your financial background."}
{"input":"Is it impossible to get a home loan with a poor credit history after a divorce?","output":"No, it is never impossible to get credit so long as there are no price controls or quotas. In most of the United States, the impetus for housing is so strong that it's one sector of credit that has nearly no price regulation, price in this case being interest rates. Corporate banks will not touch you now because Dodd-Frank now makes them liable to you and investors if you default on the mortgage.  Also, Fannie & Freddie, who ultimately finance most mortgages in the US now require banks to buy back loans if they fail, so banks are only financing the most creditworthy. All is not lost because markets are like rivers if not fully dammed: they find a way through. In your case, you can get a fully-financed mortgage if you're willing to pay interest rates probably double what you could otherwise get in the market with good credit. If the foreclosure process is quick and benefits the lender more in your state, the interest rate will be even lower. Your creditors will most likely be individuals you find at mortgage investment clubs and religious institutions.  If you shop around, you'll be surprised at how low a rate you might get. Also, since the cost of your prospective home is so low, it's very easy for an investor flush with cash and few investments to take a flier on a mother committed to her children who only needs $50,000.

{"input":"Why is there so much variability on interest rate accounts","output":"Generally, if you watch for the detail in the fine print, and stay away from non-FDIC insured investments, there is little difference, so yes, pick the highest you can get. The offered interest rate is influenced by what the banks are trying to accomplish, and how their current and desired customer base thinks. Some banks have customer bases with very conservative behavior, which will stick with them because they trust them no matter what, so a low interest rate is good enough. The disadvantage for the bank is that such customers prefer brick-and-mortar contact, which is expensive for the bank. Or maybe the bank has already more cash than they need, and has no good way to invest it. Other banks might need more cash flow to be able to get stronger in the mortgage market, and their way of getting that is to offer higher interest rates, so new customers come and invest new money (which the bank in turn can then mortgage out). They also may offer higher rates for online handling only. Overall, there are many different ways to make money as a bank, and they diversify into different niches with other focuses, and that comes with offering quite different interest rates.","instruction":"Utilize your financial knowledge, give your answer or opinion to the input question or subject .

From what you've told us, he's actually given you poor advice regarding mortgage interest rates.  Rates are already at historic lows.  That and the precarious state of the world economy mean that further rate cuts are more likely in the near term. Second piece of advice: While more information on the real estate market you're in would help,  going in at asking price is rarely a good idea.   Sale prices from \"the last few years\" are not relevant to what you should pay, because the last few years include a financial crisis caused in large part by the bursting of a housing bubble.  They could be even less relevant depending on your location because of a spike in foreclosures in certain areas of the U.S.  There was already a ton of housing inventory before, so an increase due to foreclosures is going to depress prices further.  Now that banks are finally practicing the due diligence they should have been all along, your ability to be pre-approved for large mortgage amount puts you in a strong position.   Use a tool like Zillow or Redfin to see what properties in that area have sold for over the past six months.  You should also be able to see a history of what prices the particular property you're interested in has been offered and\/or sold at in the past.  Also check and see how long the particular property you're interested in has been on the market.

{"input":"If a stock doesn't pay dividends, then why is the stock worth anything?","output":"If so, then if company A never pays dividends to its shareholders, then what is the point of owning company A's stock? The stock itself can go up in price. This is not necessarily pure speculation either, the company could just reinvest the profits and grow. Since you own part of a company, your share would also increase in value. The company could also decide to start paying dividend. I think one rule of thumb is that growing companies won't pay out, since they reinvest all profit to grow even more, but very large companies like McDonalds or Microsoft who don't really have much room left to grow will pay dividends more. Surely the right to one vote for company A's Board can't be that valuable.  Actually, Google for instance neither pays dividend nor do you get to vote. Basically all you get for your money is partial ownership of the company. This still gives you the right to seize Google assets if you go bankrupt, if there's any asset left once the creditors are done (credit gets priority over equity). What is it that I'm missing? What you are missing is that the entire concept of the dividend is an illusion. There's little qualitative difference between a stock that pays dividend, and a stock that doesn't. If you were going to buy the stock, then hold it forever and collect dividend, you could get the same thing with a dividend-less stock by simply waiting for it to gain say 5% value, then sell 4.76% of your stock and call the cash your dividend. \"But wait,\" you say, \"that's not the same - my net worth has decreased!\" Guess what, stocks that do pay dividend usually do drop in value right after the pay out, and they drop by about the relative value of the dividend as well. Likewise, you could take a stock that does pay dividend, and make it look exactly like a non-paying stock by simply taking every dividend you get and buying more of the same stock with it. So from this simplistic point of view, it is irrelevant whether the stock itself pays dividend or not. There is always the same decision of whether to cut the goose or let it lay a few more eggs that every shareholder has to make it. Paying a dividend is essentially providing a different default choice, but makes little difference with regards to your choices. There is however more to it than simple return on investment arithmetic: As I said, the alternative to paying dividend is reinvesting profits back into the enterprise. If the company decided to pay out dividend, that means they think all the best investing is done, and they don't really have a particularly good idea for what to do with the extra money. Conversely, not paying is like management telling the shareholders, \"no we're not done, we're still building our business!\". So it can be a way of judging whether the company is concentrating on generating profit or growing itself. Needless to say the, the market is wild and unpredictable and not everyone obeys such assumptions. Furthermore, as I said, you can effectively overrule the decision by increasing or decreasing your position, regardless of whether they have decided to pay dividend to begin with. Lastly, there may be some subtle differences with regards to things like how the income is taxed and so on. These don't really have much to do with the market itself, but the bureaucracy tacked onto the market.","instruction":"Share your insights or perspective on the financial matter presented in the input."}

You didn't do anything wrong but as mentioned by Ben, you are missing some monthly and yearly costs with home ownership.  I suggest visiting a bank or somewhere like coldwell banker to discuss accurate costs and regulations in your area. I know the feeling of considering paying more now for the very attractive thought of owning a home... in 30 years. After interest, you need to consider that you are paying almost double the initial principle so don't rush for something you can do a year or two down the line as a major commitment.  One major point that isn't emphasized in the current answers. You have a large family: Two children, a dog, and a cat.  I don't know the kid's ages but given you are in your early twenties and your estimated monthly costs, they are probably very young before the point they really put any stress financially but you need to budget them in exponentially. Some quick figures from experience. Closing costs including inspections, mortgage origination fee, lawyer fees, checking the history of the home for liens, etc, which will set you back minimum 5% depending on the type of purchase (short sales, foreclosures are more expensive because they take longer) Insurance (home and flood) will depend on your zoning but you can expect anywhere between $100-300 a month. For many zones it is mandatory.  Also depending on if it's a coop ($800+), condo($500+) or a townhouse-type you will need to pay different levels of monthly maintenance for the groundskeeping as a cooperative fee.  at an estimate of a 250K home, all your savings will not be able to cover your closing costs and all 250k will need to be part of your base mortgage. so your base monthly mortgage payment at around 4% will be $1,200 a month. it's too tight.

{"input":"What are the scenarios if mining company around 4c decides to halt stock trading due to capital raising?","output":"It appears that the company in question is raising money to invest in expanding its operations (specifically lithium production but that is off topic for here). The stock price was rising on the back of (perceived) increases in demand for the company's products but in order to fulfil demand they need to either invest in higher production or increase prices. They chose to increase production by investing. To invest they needed to raise capital and so are going through the motions to do that. The key question as to what will happen with their stock price after this is broken down into two parts: short term and long term: In the short term the price is driven by the expectation of future profits (see below) and the behavioural expectations from an increase in interest in the stock caused by the fact that it is in the news. People who had never heard of the stock or thought of investing in the company have suddenly discovered it and been told that it is doing well and so \"want a piece of it\". This will exacerbate the effect of the news (broadly positive or negative) and will drive the price in the short run. The effect of extra leverage (assuming that they raise capital by writing bonds) also immediately increases the total value of the company so will increase the price somewhat. The short term price changes usually pare back after a few months as the shine goes off and people take profits. For investing in the long run you need to consider how the increase in capital will be used and how demand and supply will change. Since the company is using the money to invest in factors of production (i.e. making more product) it is the return on capital (or investment) employed (ROCE) that will inform the fundamentals underlying the stock price. The higher the ROCE, the more valuable the capital raised is in the future and the more profits and the company as a whole will grow. A questing to ask yourself is whether they can employ the extra capital at the same ROCE as they currently produce. It is possible that by investing in new, more productive equipment they can raise their ROCE but also possible that, because the lithium mines (or whatever) can only get so big and can only get so much access to the seams extra capital will not be as productive as existing capital so ROCE will fall for the new capital.","instruction":"Offer your insights or judgment on the input financial query or topic using your financial expertise.

Before I begin, I worked in debt collection and I presume that the debt collection agency have requested details for a source like a college and you have been returned as a possible match as you name is identical to their debtor but with differing date of birth etc. College\/University students are very nomadic in nature and addresses aren\u2019t very helpful when they are not current, but details of a current address\/employer to a very similar name would be a possible lead to debtor and the debt collector is simply acting on flawed information which is fairly rare, and  cases such as these are resolved when you can simply confirm your date of birth and other details so that they can eliminate you from their chasing activities.  Whilst you may feel uncomfortable about giving your details, you are not the debtor and will have to confirm this, the debt collector is only interested in collection of valid debts values, and the current letter is most likely a standard letter to get you to act assuming that you are the debtor.

Has the recent change in price changed the reason you bought the stock? You must assume your losses are sunk costs. No matter what action you take, you can not recover your losses. Do not attempt to hold the stock in the hopes of regaining value, or sell it to stop losses. Instead approach this event as if this very day, you were given shares of the company's stock at their current market value for free as a gift. In this hypothetical situation, would you hold the shares, or sell them? Use that to judge your options. Not everyone, myself included, can handle the mental stress of watching share prices change. You can always consider trading index funds instead, which are much less volatile but will provide consistent, albeit, boring returns. This may or may not be you, but it's an option. Finally, do not keep money in the market you are not prepared to lose. It seems obvious, but if you lost 40% today, you could lose 100% tomorrow.","instruction":"Based on your financial expertise, provide your response or viewpoint on the given financial question or topic.

{"input":"When do I pay taxes if I'm self employed?","output":"I strongly recommend that you talk to an accountant right away because you could save some money by making a tax payment by January 15, 2014. You will receive Forms 1099-MISC from the various entities with whom you are doing business as a contractor detailing how much money they paid you. A copy will go to the IRS also. You file a Schedule C with your Form 1040 in which you detail how much you received on the 1099-MISC forms as well as any other income that your contracting business received (e.g. amounts less than $600 for which a 1099-MISc does not need to be issued, or tips, say, if you are a taxi-driver running your own cab), and you can deduct various expenses that you incurred in generating this income, including tools, books, (or gasoline!) etc that you bought for doing the job. You will need to file a Schedule SE that will compute how much you owe in Social Security and Medicare taxes on the net income on Schedule C. You will pay at twice the rate that employees pay because you get to pay not only the employee's share but also the employer's share. At least, you will not have to pay income tax on the employer's share. Your net income on Schedule C will transfer onto Form 1040 where you will compute how much income tax you owe, and then add on the Social Security tax etc to compute a final amount of tax to be paid. You will have to pay a penalty for not making tax payments every quarter during 2013, plus  interest on the tax paid late.  Send the IRS a check for the total. If you talk to an accountant right away, he\/she will likely be able to come up with a rough estimate of what you might owe, and sending in that amount by January 15 will save some money. The accountant can also help you set up for the 2014 tax year during which you could make quarterly payments of estimated tax for 2014 and avoid the penalties and interest referred to above.","instruction":"Offer your thoughts or opinion on the input financial query or topic using your financial background."}

Let's assume that we know the WSC's affordability and therefore the monthly premium is a fixed determined number, then there is a inverse relationship between the length of coverage and the amount of coverage. We have to achieve a balance between these two factors to best meet the WSC's objective.

{"input":"What are the economic benefits of owning a home in the United States?","output":"To add to what other have stated, I recently just decided to purchase a home over renting some more, and I'll throw in some of my thoughts about my decision to buy. I closed a couple of weeks ago. Note that I live in Texas, and that I'm not knowledgeable in real estate other than what I learned from my experiences in the area when I am located. It depends on the market and location. You have to compare what renting will get you for the money vs what buying will get you. For me, buying seemed like a better deal overall when just comparing monthly payments. This is including insurance and taxes. You will need to stay at a house that you buy for at least 5-7 years. You first couple years of payments will go almost entirely towards interest. It takes a while to build up equity. If you can pay more towards a mortgage, do it. You need to have money in the bank already to close. The minimum down payment (at least in my area) is 3.5% for an FHA loan. If you put 20% down, you don't need to pay mortgage insurance, which is essentially throwing money away. You will also have add in closing costs. I ended up purchasing a new construction. My monthly payment went up from $1200 to $1600 (after taxes, insurance, etc.), but the house is bigger, newer, more energy efficient, much closer to my work, in a more expensive area, and in a market that is expected to go up in value. I had all of my closing costs (except for the deposit) taken care of by the lender and builder, so all of my closing costs I paid out of pocket went to the deposit (equity, or the \"bank\"). If I decide to move and need to sell, then I will get a lot (losing some to selling costs and interest) of the money I have put in to the house back out of it when I do sell, and I have the option to put that money towards another house. To sum it all up, I'm not paying a difference in monthly costs because I bought a house. I had my closing costs taking care of and just had to pay the deposit, which goes to equity. I will have to do maintenance myself, but I don't mind fixing what I can fix, and I have a builder's warranties on most things in the house.  To really get a good idea of whether you should rent or buy, you need to talk to a Realtor and compare actual costs. It will be more expensive in the short term, but should save you money in the long term.","instruction":"Share your insights or perspective on the financial matter presented in the input."}
{"input":"Are these scenarios considered as taxable income?","output":"You can always reduce the income by the direct expenses required to earn it, and figure out whether it is ultimately a net profit or loss.   The net profit is taxable income.  The loss may be tax deductible if the underlying thing is tax deductible.    For the book, the $50 revenue required a $100 expense, so that's a $50 net loss.  You don't owe any income tax since it's a loss.  You could take the loss as a tax deduction if you have a business trading books, or if buying the book would be tax deductible for some reason.  Note that in the latter case you can only deduct the $50 not the $100.  For the airline ticket, it is to compensate you for the losses you took as a result if the delayed flight. So you tally up the $22 meal you had in the airport waiting for news, the $110 on the motel room you rented or forfeited, any other way you can peg a cash value to any losses you took.  Total them up, again, a net loss is only deductible if the travel is already deductible. Note that if the actual expenses (book, flight) were tax deductible for some reason, the cash-back reduces the amount of your tax deduction, so it has the same effect as the sale\/gift being taxable income.","instruction":"Share your insights or perspective on the financial matter presented in the input."}
{"input":"Is diversification better","output":"Diversification is the only real free lunch in finance (reduction in risk without any reduction in expected returns), so clearly every good answer to your question will be \"yes.\"  Diversification is good.\"  Let's talk about many details your question solicits. Many funds are already pretty diversified.  If you buy a mutual fund, you are generally already getting a large portion of the gains from diversification.  There is a very large difference between the unnecessary risk in your portfolio if you only hold a couple of stocks and if you hold a mutual fund.  Should you be diversified across mutual funds as well?  It depends on what your funds are.  Many funds, such as target-date funds, are intended to be your sole investment.  If you have funds covering every major asset class, then there may not be any additional benefit to buying other funds. You probably could not have picked your \"favorite fund\" early on.  As humans, we have cognitive biases that make us think we knew things early on that we did not.  I'm sure at some point at the very beginning you had a positive feeling toward that fund.  Today you regret not acting on it and putting all your money there.  But the number of such feelings is very large and if you acted on all those, you would do a lot of crazy and harmful things.  You didn't know early on which fund would do well.  You could just as well have had a good feeling about a fund that subsequently did much worse than your diversified portfolio did. The advice you have had about your portfolio probably isn't based on sound finance theory.  You say you have always kept your investments in line with your age.  This implies that you believe the guidelines given you by your broker or financial advisor are based in finance theory.  Generally speaking, they are not.  They are rules of thumb that seemed good to someone but are not rigorously proven either in theory or empirics.  For example the notion that you should slowly shift your investments from speculative to conservative as you age is not based on sound finance theory.  It just seems good to the people who give advice on such things.  Nothing particularly wrong with it, I guess, but it's not remotely on par with the general concept of being well-diversified.  The latter is extremely well established and verified, both in theory and in practice.  Don't confuse the concept of diversification with the specific advice you have received from your advisor. A fund averaging very good returns is not an anomaly--at least going forward it will not be.  There are many thousand funds and a large distribution in their historical performance.  Just by random chance, some funds will have a truly outstanding track record.  Perhaps the manager really was skilled.  However, very careful empirical testing has shown the following: (1) You, me, and people whose profession it is to select outperforming mutual funds are unable to reliably detect which ones will outperform, except in hindsight  (2) A fund that has outperformed, even over a long horizon, is not more likely to outperform in the future. No one is stopping you from putting all your money in that fund. Depending on its investment objective, you may even have decent diversification if you do so.  However, please be aware that if you move your money based on historical outperformance, you will be acting on the same cognitive bias that makes gamblers believe they are on a \"hot streak\" and \"can't lose.\"  They can, and so can you. ======== Edit to answer a more specific line of questions =========== One of your questions is whether it makes sense to buy a number of mutual funds as part of your diversification strategy.  This is a slightly more subtle question and I will indicate where there is uncertainty in my answer.   Diversifying across asset classes.  Most of the gains from diversification are available in a single fund.  There is a lot of idiosyncratic risk in one or two stocks and much less in a collection of hundreds of stocks, which is what any mutual fund will hold.  Still,you will probably want at least a couple of funds in your portfolio.  I will list them from most important to least and I will assume the bulk of your portfolio is in a total US equity fund (or S&P500-style fund) so that you are almost completely diversified already. Risky Bonds.  These are corporate, municipal, sovereign debt, and long-term treasury debt funds. There is almost certainly a good deal to be gained by having a portion of your portfolio in bonds, and normally a total market fund will not include bond exposure.  Bonds fund returns are closely related to interest rate and inflation changes.  They are also exposed to some market risk but it's more efficient to get that from equity.  The bond market is very large, so if you did market weights you would have more in bonds than in equity.  Normally people do not do this, though.  Instead you can get the exposure to interest rates by holding a lesser amount in longer-term bonds, rather than more in shorter-term bonds.  I don't believe in shifting your weights toward nor away from this type of bond (as opposed to equity) as you age so if you are getting that advice, know that it is not well-founded in theory.  Whatever your relative weight in risky bonds when you are young is should also be your weight when you are older. International. There are probably some gains from having some exposure to international markets, although these have decreased over time as economies have become more integrated.  If we followed market weights, you would actually put half your equity weight in an international fund.  Because international funds are taxed differently (gains are always taxed at the short-term capital gains rate) and because they have higher management fees, most people make only a small investment to international funds, if any at all. Emerging markets  International funds often ignore emerging markets in order to maintain liquidity and low fees.  You can get some exposure to these markets through emerging markets funds.  However, the value of public equity in emerging markets is small when compared with that of developed markets, so according to finance theory, your investment in them should be small as well.  That's a theoretical, not an empirical result. Emerging market funds charge high fees as well, so this one is kind of up to your taste.  I can't say whether it will work out in the future. Real estate.  You may want to get exposure to real estate by buying a real-estate fund (REIT).  Though, if you own a house you are already exposed to the real estate market, perhaps more than you want to be.  REITs often invest in commercial real estate, which is a little different from the residential market. Small Cap.  Although total market funds invest in all capitalization levels, the market is so skewed toward large firms that many total market funds don't have any significant small cap exposure.  It's common for individuals to hold a small cap fund to compensate for this, but it's not actually required by investment theory.  In principle, the most diversified portfolio should be market-cap weighted, so small cap should have negligible weight in your portfolio.  Many people hold small cap because historically it has outperformed large cap firms of equal risk, but this trend is uncertain.  Many researchers feel that the small cap \"premium\" may have been a short-term artifact in the data.  Given these facts and the fact that small-cap funds charge higher fees, it may make sense to pass on this asset class.  Depends on your opinion and beliefs. Value (or Growth) Funds.  Half the market can be classed as \"value\", while the other half is \"growth.\"  Your total market fund should have equal representation in both so there is no diversification reason to buy a special value or growth fund.  Historically, value funds have outperformed over long horizons and many researchers think this will continue, but it's not exactly mandated by the theory.  If you choose to skew your portfolio by buying one of these, it should be a value fund. Sector funds.  There is, in general, no diversification reason to buy funds that invest in a particular sector.  If you are trying to hedge your income (like trying to avoid investing in the tech sector because you work in that sector) or your costs (buying energy because you buy use a disproportionate amount of energy) I could imagine you buying one of these funds. Risk-free bonds.  Funds specializing in short-term treasuries or short-term high-quality bonds of other types are basically a substitute for a savings account, CD, money market fund, or other cash equivalent.  Use as appropriate but there is little diversification here per se. In short, there is some value in diversifying across asset classes, and it is open to opinion how much you should do.  Less well-justified is diversifying across managers within the same asset class.  There's very little if any advantage to doing that.","instruction":"Utilize your financial knowledge, give your answer or opinion to the input question or subject . Answer format is not limited."}

{"input":"What is the most effective saving money method? ","output":"Envelope budgeting is pretty simple. It's easy enough that you can teach it to children, and flexible enough you can use it as an adult.   The general idea is that you take your cash money (no bank accounts involved in the simple version), and stick it in envelopes marked for what it's supposed to be for. So for example, you get paid, you cash your paycheck and you put $100 in an envelope marked food.  Now when you go out to eat, you go get the money out of your food envelope, and spend it on food.  When your food envelope is empty you go hungry.   In the simple version you have envelopes for things like \"food\", \"candy\", \"toys\", \"games\". etc. (simple version is usually taught to kids.)  So you want a $60 game, and your game envelope only has $5. Well you can't get the game. You need to add more money to the game envelope. You need to eat so you have to put money there, but maybe you don't need toys. So you can divert some incoming money from toys to games. Sure it's still going to take a while to get to $60, but now with some simple kid friendly math you can see how long, and more importantly, you can make decisions on what is more important. Candy or Toys? In the adult version things are much the same. We just have more envelopes. We have Rent, Car Payment, Gas, Food, Electric. Then we need some envelopes for \"savings\" and \"retirement\". etc. Now when you get your Paycheck you prioritize your money and you stuff it in the envelopes. How much you put in each envelope is easy. Enough to pay for that thing. Savings and Retirement meet different goals. You want $6,000 savings. Well just like that game in the kid version, you're not going to get there all at once.  But you can see and make decisions on what is most important. You want $1,000,000 to retire on. Sure, but that envelope is going to take a while to fill up.  At it's core, the important parts are that: Let me explain the rent example, as it's the oddest.  You get $500 a week, and you need $1000 for rent.  This means you're spending from your envelopes. During week 1 and 2 you're spending last months week 3 and 4.  You DO NOT do: This is important because if you lose your paycheck in week 3 or 4 you are homeless.  Finally, in general, you stick stuff in savings envelope. And you want to reach a savings envelope goal of 6 months of your average pay checks. Once you reach this goal, then you're in good shape, and a job loss doesn't mean you're homeless. You can always just pull from savings.  It's important when using these envelopes to understand that you only make the decision of what is more important when you're sticking money in, not when you're taking money out, and that you only work with the money you have right now today (in your hand). Now what you think you're going to get tomorrow.  Money in the bank can be split into virtual envelopes. Money in savings can be in any vehicle, but generally you want a short term emergency envelope (savings account) and a long term envelope (CDs for example). Take a look at YNAB.com they used to provide free lessons in using their software to manage an envelope system.  And the I know it's going to get comments section.  The rent v.s. homeless is a real example. You should not take money from, say, the food envelope, to cover the rent. This may seem silly, but if you're doing that then you made poor decisions when deciding where the money goes. Use the emergency fund envelope to cover the rent, and next time put less money into food. It's this \"rule\" that makes envelope budgeting work well. You may be homeless, but you can eat, drive to work, put gas in your car, and pay your bills. Taking money from different envelopes usually results in a spiral, where you attempt to do the sensible thing, but in the end, you're worse off.  Migrating to envelope budgeting (in the strict sense) is hard. The best way I have taught people to do it is to only envelope budget an increasing part of their income until their envelopes are full enough for one month. That means that you might only envelope budget 10% of your income at first. But unless your situation is such that you can cover all your bills with one paycheck, it's not going to be possible to transition without breaking the \"don't take money from other envelope\" rules.","instruction":"Offer your thoughts or opinion on the input financial query or topic using your financial background."}

{"input":"Tax and financial implications of sharing my apartment with my partner","output":"I am not a lawyer nor a tax accountant, so if such chimes in here I'll gladly defer. But my understanding is:  If you're romantically involved and living together you're considered a \"household\" and thus your finances are deemed shared for tax purposes. Any money your partner gives you toward paying the bills is not considered \"rent\" but \"her contribution to household expenses\". (I don't know the genders but I'll call your partner \"her\" for convenience.) This is not income and is not taxed. On the off chance that the IRS actually investigated your arrangement, don't call any money she gives you \"rent\": call it \"her contribution to living expenses\". If you were two (or more) random people sharing a condo purely for economic reasons, i.e. you are not a family in any sense but each of you would have trouble affording a place on your own, it's common for all the room mates to share the rent or mortgage, utilities, etc, but for one person to collect all the money and write one check to the landlord, etc. Tax law does not see this as the person who writes the check collecting rent from the others, it's just a book-keeping convenience, and so there is no taxable transaction. (Of course the landlord owes taxes on the rental income, but that's not your problem.) In that case it likely would be different if one person outright owned the place and really was charging the others rent. But then he could claim deductions for all the expenses of maintaining it, including depreciation, so if it really was a case of room mates sharing expenses, the taxable income would likely be just about zero anyway. So short answer: If you really are a \"couple\", there are no taxable transactions here. If the IRS should actually question it, don't refer to it as \"collecting rent\" or any other words that imply this is a business arrangement. Describe it as a couple sharing expenses. (People sometimes have created tax problems for themselves by their choice of words in an audit.) But the chance that you would ever be audited over something like this is probably remote. I suppose that if at some point you break up, but you continue to live together for financial reasons (or whatever reasons), that could transform this into a business relationship and that would change my answer.","instruction":"Share your insights or perspective on the financial matter presented in the input."}

{"input":"Are stock index fund likely to keep being a reliable long-term investment option?","output":"A diversified portfolio (such as a 60% stocks \/ 40% bonds balanced fund) is much more predictable and reliable than an all-stocks portfolio, and the returns are perfectly adequate. The extra returns on 100% stocks vs. 60% are 1.2% per year (historically) according to https:\/\/personal.vanguard.com\/us\/insights\/saving-investing\/model-portfolio-allocations To get those average higher stock returns, you need to be thinking 20-30 years (even 10 years is too short-term). Over the 20-30 years, you must never panic and go to cash, or you will destroy the higher returns. You must never get discouraged and stop saving, or you will destroy the higher returns. You have to avoid the panic and discouragement despite the likelihood that some 10-year period in your 20-30 years the stock market will go nowhere. You also must never have an emergency or other reason to withdraw money early. If you look at \"dry periods\" in stocks, like 2000 to 2011, a 60\/40 portfolio made significant money and stocks went nowhere. A diversified portfolio means that price volatility makes you money (due to rebalancing) while a 100% stocks portfolio means that price volatility is just a lot of stress with no benefit. It's somewhat possible, probably, to predict dry periods in stocks; if I remember the statistics, about 50% of the variability in the market price 10 years out can be explained by normalized market valuation (normalized = adjusted for business cycle and abnormal profit margins). Some funds such as http:\/\/hussmanfunds.com\/ are completely based on this, though a lot of money managers consider it. With a balanced portfolio and rebalancing, though, you don't have to worry about it very much. In my view, the proper goal is not to beat the market, nor match the market, nor is it to earn the absolute highest possible returns. Instead, the goal is to have the highest chance of financing your non-financial goals (such as retirement, or buying a house). To maximize your chances of supporting your life goals with your financial decisions, predictability is more important than maximized returns. Your results are primarily determined by your savings rate - which realistic investment returns will never compensate for if it's too low. You can certainly make a 40-year projection in which 1.2% difference in returns makes a big difference. But you have to remember that a projection in which value steadily and predictably compounds is not the same as real life, where you could have emergency or emotional factors, where the market will move erratically and might have a big plunge at just the wrong time (end of the 40 years), and so on. If your plan \"relies\" on the extra 1.2% returns then it's not a reasonable plan anyhow, in my opinion, since you can't count on them.

{"input":"Is it smart to only invest in mid- and small-cap stock equity funds in my 401(k)?","output":"If the stock market dropped 30%-40% next month, providing you with a rare opportunity to buy stocks at a deep discount, wouldn't you want to have some of your assets in investments other than stocks? If you don't otherwise have piles of new cash to throw into the market when it significantly tanks, then having some of your portfolio invested elsewhere will enable you to back up the proverbial truck and load up on more stocks while they are on sale. I'm not advocating active market timing. Rather, the way that long-term investors capitalize on such opportunities is by choosing a portfolio asset allocation that includes some percentage of safer assets (e.g. cash, short term bonds, etc.), permitting the investor to rebalance the portfolio periodically back to target allocations (e.g. 80% stocks, 20% bonds.) When rebalancing would have you buy stocks, it's usually because they are on sale. Similarly, when rebalancing would have you sell stocks, it's usually because they are overpriced. So, don't consider \"safer investments\" strictly as a way to reduce your risk. Rather, they can give you the means to take advantage of market drops, rather than just riding it out when you are already 100% invested in stocks.

So essentially, at least 20% of your equity in A will remain on the paper. Banks don't like seeing the down-payment coming from anywhere other than your savings. Putting the downpayment from loan proceeds, even if not secured by the property which you're refinancing, will probably scare banks off. How to solve this? Suggest to deal with it as a business, putting both properties under a company\/LLC, if possible. It might be hard to change the titles while you have loans on your properties, but even without it - deal with it as if it is a business. Approach your bank for a business loan - either secured by A or unsecured, and another investment loan for B. Describe your strategy to the banker (preferably a small community bank in the area where the properties are), and how you're going to fund the properties. You won't get rates as low as you have on A (3.25% on investment loan? Not a chance, that one is a keeper), but you might be able to get rid of the balloon\/variable APR problem.","instruction":"Utilize your financial knowledge, give your answer or opinion to the input question or subject .

{"input":"Should a high-school student invest their (relative meager) savings?","output":"You have a few correlated questions here:  Yes you can. There are only a few investment strategies that require a minimum contribution and those aren't ones that would get a blanket recommendation anyway. Investing in bonds or stocks is perfectly possible with limited funds. You're never too young to start. The power of interest means that the more time you give your money to grow, the larger your eventual gains will be (provided your investment is beating inflation). If your financial situation allows it, it makes sense to invest money you don't need immediately, which brings us to: This is the one you have to look at most. You're young but have a nice chunk of cash in a savings account. That money won't grow much and you could be losing purchasing power to inflation but on the other hand that money also isn't at risk. While there are dozens of investment options1 the two main ones to look at are: bonds: these are fixed income, which means they're fairly safe, but the downside is that you need to lock up your money for a long time to get a better interest rate than a savings account index funds that track the market: these are basically another form of stock where each share represents fractions of shares of other companies that are tracked on an index such as the S&P 500 or Nasdaq. These are much riskier and more volatile, which is why you should look at this as a long-term investment as well because given enough time these are expected to trend upwards. Look into index funds further to understand why. But this isn't so much about what you should invest in, but more about the fact that an investment, almost by definition, means putting money away for a long period of time. So the real question remains: how much can you afford to put away? For that you need to look at your individual situation and your plans for the future. Do you need that money to pay for expenses in the coming years? Do you want to save it up for college? Do you want to invest and leave it untouched to inspire you to keep saving? Do you want to save for retirement? (I'm not sure if you can start saving via IRAs and the like at your age but it's worth looking into.) Or do you want to spend it on a dream holiday or a car? There are arguments to be made for every one of those.  Most people will tell you to keep such a \"low\" sum in a savings account as an emergency fund but that also depends on whether you have a safety net (i.e. parents) and how reliable they are. Most people will also tell you that your long-term money should be in the stock market in the form of a balanced portfolio of index funds. But I won't tell you what to do since you need to look at your own options and decide for yourself what makes sense for you. You're off to a great start if you're thinking about this at your age and I'd encourage you to take that interest further and look into educating yourself on the investments options and funds that are available to you and decide on a financial plan. Involving your parents in that is sensible, not in the least because your post-high school plans will be the most important variable in said plan. To recap my first point and answer your main question, if you've decided that you want to invest and you've established a specific budget, the size of that investment budget should not factor into what you invest it in. 1 - For the record: penny stocks are not an investment. They're an expensive form of gambling.","instruction":"Utilize your financial knowledge, give your answer or opinion to the input question or subject . Answer format is not limited."}
{"input":"How does the Pension system work in Poland?","output":"littleadv's answer gives a concise summary of the system as it stands now, but much more changed than just the portion of the mandatory contribution that was diverted to the private plan. In broad terms, the balances of your accounts and your future benefit won't change. It's only the source of these benefits that's changing. The Bloomberg article describes the changes this way: The state will take over the amount of bonds that pension funds held as of end of Sept. 3 and turn them into pension liabilities in the state-run social security system... The state will assume control of 51.5 percent of pension-fund assets, including bonds guaranteed by the government and \u201cother non-stock assets\u201d After the change, Polish workers that held bonds in the private portion of their retirement portfolios will instead have more payments from the state-run pension system. The balances of your retirement portfolio and your future benefits shouldn't change, but the reality may depend on how the state pension system is managed and any future changes the government implements. The effect this change will have on future benefits isn't clear, because the change may simply delay the problem of high levels of outstanding sovereign debt, not solve it. The government stated that because increasing numbers of workers invested their money in private pension funds, less money went into the government's fund, which forced them to issue sovereign debt in order to cover the shortfall in their current pension liabilities.  The government's recent cancellation of government bonds in the hands of private pensions will decrease their overall outstanding debt, but in exchange, the government is increasing its future pension liabilities. Years down the road, the government may find that they need to issue more sovereign debt to cover the increased pension liabilities they're taking on today. In other words, they may find themselves back in the same situation years down the road, and it's difficult to predict what changes they might make at that time.","instruction":"Utilize your financial knowledge, give your answer or opinion to the input question or subject .

{"input":"What is the purpose of property tax?","output":"Governments only have a few ways to get income: tax income, tax consumption, tax property (cars & boats), tax real estate, or tax services (hotel & meals). The National, state, county, city, and town taxing authorities determine what is taxed and what the rate will be to get enough money to run their share of the government. In general the taxing of real estate is done by the local government, but the ability to tax real estate is granted to them by the state. In the United States the local government decides, generally through a public hearing, what the rate will be. You can usually determine the current rate and tax value of the home prior to purchase. Though some jurisdictions limit the annual growth of value of the property, and then catch it up when the property is sold. That information is also in  public records.   All taxes are used to build roads, pay for public safety, schools, libraries, parks.. the list is very long. Failure to pay the tax will result in a lien on the property, which can result in your losing the property in a tax sale.  Most of the time the bank or mortgage company insists that your monthly payment to them includes the monthly portion of the estimated property tax, and the fire insurance on the property. This is called escrow. This makes sure the money is available when the tax is due. In some places is is paid yearly, on other places every six months. With an escrow account the bank will send the money to the government or insurance company. Here is the big secret: you have been indirectly paying property tax. The owner of the apartment , townhouse, or home you have been renting has been paying the tax from your monthly payment to them.","instruction":"Offer your thoughts or opinion on the input financial query or topic using your financial background."}
{"input":"Is there anything I can do to prepare myself for the tax consequences of selling investments to buy a house?","output":"Don't let tax considerations be the main driver. That's generally a bad idea. You should keep tax in mind when making the decision, but don't let it be the main reason for an action. selling the higher priced shares (possibly at a loss even) - I think   it's ok to do that, and it doesn't necessarily have to be FIFO? It is OK to do that, but consider also the term. Long term gain has much lower taxes than short term gain, and short term loss will be offsetting long term gain - means you can lose some of the potential tax benefit. any potential writeoffs related to buying a home that can offset capital gains? No, and anyway if you're buying a personal residence (a home for yourself) - there's nothing to write off (except for the mortgage interest and property taxes of course). selling other investments for a capital loss to offset this sale? Again - why sell at a loss? anything related to retirement accounts? e.g. I think I recall being able to take a loan from your retirement account in order to buy a home You can take a loan, and you can also withdraw up to 10K without a penalty (if conditions are met). Bottom line - be prepared to pay the tax on the gains, and check how much it is going to be roughly. You can apply previous year refund to the next year to mitigate the shock, you can put some money aside, and you can raise your salary withholding to make sure you're not hit with a high bill and penalties next April after you do that. As long as you keep in mind the tax bill and put aside an amount to pay it - you'll be fine. I see no reason to sell at loss or pay extra interest to someone just to reduce the nominal amount of the tax. If you're selling at loss - you're losing money. If you're selling at gain and paying tax - you're earning money, even if the earnings are reduced by the tax.","instruction":"Offer your thoughts or opinion on the input financial query or topic using your financial background."}
{"input":"Can paying down a mortgage be considered an \u201cinvestment\u201d?","output":"It very much comes down to question of semantics and your particular situation. Some people do not view a house (and most upgrades) as an investment, but rather an expense.  I certainly agree that this is probably the case if you pay someone else to make the repairs and upgrades.  However, if you are a serious DIYer, that may not be the case.  Of course, if the house is a money pit and\/or you were unfortunate to buy when prices where ridiculously high, you'll have a hard time making any money on this \"investment.\"  To continue this game of semantics, you may also consider the value you extract from your home while you are living in it. On to the mortgage itself.  Chances are that it is a long term, relatively low rate loan and that the interest is deductible.  So, there are some disadvantages to paying it down early, even without early payment penalties.  Paying down early on the principal is a disadvantage from a tax perspective.  How much of a disadvantage hinges on the rate. Now, a debt is a liability on your personal balance sheet.  It drags down any returns you may have from investing.  However, a home lone is not generally subject to the cardinal rule of paying off your high interest debt before investing.  It should not be relatively high and it pays for something necessary.  It may be that any credit card debt you have may have paid for something considered necessary.  However, with the relatively high interest rates, you have to question just how necessary any credit card debt really is.  Not to mention that there is no tax advantage. So, it comes down to the fact that a home loan should be relatively low interest, paying for something you must have and that you hopefully have some tax advantage from the interest you pay on it.","instruction":"Share your insights or perspective on the financial matter presented in the input."}

{"input":"How can someone invest in areas that require you to be an accredited investor [without qualifying as an accredited investor]?","output":"Unfortunately it is not possible for an ordinary person to become an accredited investor without a career change. Gaining any legal certification in investments typically require sponsorship from an investment company (which you would be working for). There are reasons why these kinds of investments are not available to ordinary people directly, and you should definitely consult an RIA (registered investment adviser) before investing in something that isn't extremely standardized (traded on an major exchange). The issue with these kinds of investments is that they are not particularly standardized (in terms of legal structure\/settlement terms). Registered investment advisers and other people who manage investments professionally are (theoretically) given specific training to understand these kinds of non-standard investments and are (theoretically) qualified to analyze the legal documentation of these, make well informed investment decisions, and make sure that their investors are not falling into any kind of pyramid scheme.  There are many many kinds of issues that can arise when investing in startups. What % of the company\/ the company's profits are you entitled to? How long can the company go without paying you a dividend? Do they have to pay you a dividend at all? How liquid will your investment in the company be? Unfortunately it is common for startups to accept investment but have legal restrictions on their investors ability to sell their stake in the business, and other non-standard contract clauses. For example, some investment agreements have a clause which states that you can only sell your stake in the business to a person who already owns a stake in the business. This makes your investment essentially worthless - the company could run for an exponential amount of time without paying you a dividend. If you are not able to sell your stake in the company you will not be able to earn any capital gains either. The probability of a startup eventually going public is extremely small.. so in this scenario it is likely you will end up gaining no return investment (though you can be happy to know you helped a company grow!)  Overall, the restrictions for these kinds of investments exist to protect ordinary folks from making investing their savings into things that could get them burned.

Your cards can get compromised, and sometimes more than one gets compromised at the same time.  I was glad that I had three cards, because two of them got hit the same day.

As quantycuenta & littleadv have said, it is absolutely true that professionals \"prey\" on less-sophisticated market participants. They aren't in the market for charity's sake.  If you're not familiar with the definition of the word \"arbitrage\", look it up.  One possible strategy that can be employed with HFT machinery in order to arbitrage successfully in the stock market is to 'intercept' orders that are placed on various exchanges. In order to do this, an HFT organization watches all the transactions at once to find opportunities to buy low and sell high.  A good explanation of it is described here in this NY Times article; I'll paraphrase what that article lays out.  Stocks are traded through multiple exchanges The first key point to understand is that stocks listed on one exchange (i.e. the NYSE) can be sold on multiple exchanges. That's where the actual \"I would like to sell 100 shares of Ford stock\" is matched with \"I would like to buy 100 shares of Ford stock.\" There are multiple clearinghouses on the various exchanges. Your order gets presented to one exchange at a Time An ideal market maker would like to look at the order books for a given stock, say Ford, and see that in exchange A there's a sell order for 100 shares of F at $15.85, and in exchange B there's a buy order for 100 shares of F at $15.90.  Arbitrage Market maker buys from A, sells in B, and pockets $0.05 * 100... $5. It's not much, but it was relatively risk free. Also, scale this up to the scale of the US' multiple stock exchanges, and there are lots of opportunities to make $5 every second.  Computers are (of course) faster than people To tie it in completely with your question about 'picking off trades', HFT rigs can be set up and programmed to go faster than an average retail investor's order.  Let's say you execute the trade to buy 100 shares @ $15.85 as a retail investor. The HFT rigs see your order starting to make the rounds of the different exchanges that your brokerage works through, and go out in front in a matter of milliseconds, finding the orders that are less than $15.85 and less than or equal to 100 shares. They execute a transaction, buy them up, sell to you, and pocket the difference.  You have been \"picked off\".  It's admittedly not the only way to use HFT equipment to make money, but it's definitely one way to do it.","instruction":"Based on your financial expertise, provide your response or viewpoint on the given financial question or topic.

The deposit protection scheme ( https:\/\/www.depositprotection.com\/ ) is one way that deposits are securely held in this manner. As a third party they will have different account details. It may be the case that the agency is protecting the deposit and you are paying rent to the landlord directly. This means that your deposit goes to the agency's account and the rent goes to the landlord's account. Obviously your landlord and agency have different accounts.

{"input":"GnuCash: expense tracking\/amounts left under limits","output":"Yes.  The simplest option to track your spending over time is to familiarize yourself with the \"Reports\" menu on the toolbar.  Take a look specifically at the \"Reports > Income\/Expense > Income Statement\" report, which will sum up your income and spending over a time frame (defaults to the current year). In each report that you run, there is an \"Options\" button at the top of the screen.  Open that and look on the \"General\" tab, you'll be able to set the time frame that the report displays (if you wanted to set it for the 2 week block since your last paycheck, for example).  Other features you're going to want to familiarize yourself with are the Expense charts & statements, the \"Cash Flow\" report, and the \"Budgeting\" interface (which is relatively new), although there is a bit of a learning curve to using this last feature. Most of the good ideas when it comes to tracking your spending are independent of the software you're using, but can be augmented with a good financial tracking program.  For example, in our household we have multiple credit cards which we pay in full every month.  We selected our cards on specific benefits that they provide, such as one card which has a rotating category for cash back at certain business types.  We keep that card set on restaurants and put all of our \"eating out\" expenses on that card.  We have other cards for groceries, gas, etc.  This makes it easy to see how much we've spent in a given category, and correlates well with the account structure in gnucash.","instruction":"Offer your insights or judgment on the input financial query or topic using your financial expertise.

The closing price quoted in papers is usually the price at the close on the NYSE.  However, options close after that and so there is after-the-close trading in many stocks with active options, so the price at the close of options trading at CBOE is often used. The \"real\" price is always changing.  But for the purpose of discussion, using the closing price in NYSE (for NYSE listed stocks) is pretty standard and unlikely to be questioned.

{"input":"Why does the biotechnology industry have such a high PE ratio?","output":"I want to elaborate on some of the general points made in the other answers, since there is a lot that is special or unique to the biotech industry. By definition, a high P\/E ratio for an industry can stem from 1) high prices\/demand for companies in the industry, and\/or 2) low earnings in the industry. On average, the biotech industry exhibits both high demand (and therefore high prices) and low earnings, hence its average P\/E ratio. My answer is somewhat US-specific (mainly the parts about the FDA) but the rest of the information is relevant elsewhere. The biotech industry is a high-priced industry because for several reasons, some investors consider it an industry with significant growth potential. Also, bringing a drug to market requires a great deal of investment over several years, at minimum. A new drug may turn out to be highly profitable in the future, but the earliest the company could begin earning this profit is after the drug nears completion of Phase III clinical trials and passes the FDA approval process.  Young, small-cap biotech companies may therefore have low or negative earnings for extended periods because they face high R&D costs throughout the lengthy process of bringing their first drug (or later drugs) to market. This process can be on the order of decades. These depressed earnings, along with high demand for the companies, either through early investors, mergers and acquisitions, etc. can lead to high P\/E ratios.  I addressed in detail several of the reasons why biotech companies are in demand now in another answer, but I want to add some information about the role of venture capital in the biotech industry that doesn't necessarily fit into the other answer. Venture capital is most prevalent in tech industries because of their high upfront capital requirements, and it's even more important for young biotech companies because they require sophisticated computing and laboratory equipment and highly-trained staff before they can even begin their research. These capital requirement are only expected to rise as subfields like genetic engineering become more widespread in the industry; when half the staff of a young company have PhD's in bioinformatics and they need high-end computing power to evaluate their models, you can see why the initial costs can be quite high. To put this in perspective, in 2010, \"venture capitalists invested approximately $22 billion into nearly 2,749 companies.\" That comes out to roughly $7.8M per company. The same year (I've lost the article that mentioned this, unfortunately), the average venture capital investment in the biotech industry was almost double that, at $15M. Since many years can elapse between initial investment in a biotech company and the earliest potential for earnings, these companies may require large amounts of early investment to get them through this period. It's also important to understand why the biotech industry, as a whole, may exhibit low earnings for a long period after the initial investment. Much of this has to do with the drug development process and the phases of clinical trials. The biotech industry isn't 100% dedicated to pharmaceutical development, but the overlap is so significant that the following information is more than applicable. Drug development usually goes through three phases: Drug discovery - This is the first research stage, where companies look for new chemical compounds that might have pharmaceutical applications. Compounds that pass this stage are those that are found to be effective against some biological target, although their effects on humans may not be known. Pre-clinical testing - In this stage, the company tests the drug for toxicity to major organs and potential side effects on other parts of the body. Through laboratory and animal testing, the company determines that the drug, in certain doses, is likely safe for use in humans. Once a drug passes the tests in this stage, the company submits an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA. This application contains results from the animal\/laboratory tests, details of the manufacturing process, and detailed proposals for human clinical trials should the FDA approve the company's IND application.  Clinical trials - If the FDA approves the IND application, the company moves forward with clinical trials in human, which are themselves divided into several stages. \"Post-clinical phase\" \/ ongoing trials - This stage is sometimes considered Phase IV of the clinical trials stage. Once the drug has been approved by the FDA or other regulatory agency, the company can ramp up its marketing efforts to physicians and consumers. The company will likely continue conducting clinical trials, as well as monitoring data on the widespread use of the drug, to both watch for unforeseen side effects or opportunities for off-label use. I included such detailed information on the drug development process because it's vitally important to realize that each and every step in this process has a cost, both in time and money. Most biopharm companies won't begin to realize profits from a successful drug until near the end of Phase III clinical trials. The vast R&D costs, in both time and money, required to bring an effective drug through all of these steps and into the marketplace can easily depress earnings for many years.  Also, keep in mind that most of the compounds identified in the drug discovery stage won't become profitable pharmaceutical products. A company may identify 5,000 compounds that show promise in the drug discovery stage. On average, less than ten of these compounds will qualify for human tests. These ten drugs may start human trials, but only around 20% of them will actually pass Phase III clinical trials and be submitted for FDA approval. The pre-clinical testing stage alone takes an average of 10 years to complete for a single drug. All this time, the company isn't earning profit on that drug. The linked article also goes into detail about recruitment delays in human trials, scheduling problems, and attrition rates for each phase of the drug development process. All of these items add both temporal and financial costs to the process and have the potential to further depress earnings. And finally, a drug could be withdrawn from the market even after it passes the drug development process. When this occurs, however, it's usually the fault of the company for poor trial design or suppression of data (as in the case of Vioxx). I want to make one final point to keep in mind when looking at financial statistics like the P\/E ratio, as well as performance and risk metrics. Different biotech funds don't necessarily represent the industry in the same way, since not all of these funds invest in the same firms. For example, the manager of Fidelity's Select Biotechnology Portfolio (FBIOX) has stated that he prefers to weight his fund towards medium to large cap companies that already have established cash flows. Like all biopharm companies, these firms face the R&D costs associated with the drug development process, but the cost to their bottom line isn't as steep because they already have existing cash flows to sustain their business and accumulated human capital that should (ideally) make the development process more efficient for newer drugs.  You can also see differences in composition between funds with similar strategies. The ishares Nasdaq Biotech Index Fund (IBB) also contains medium to large cap companies, but the composition of its top 10 holdings is slightly different from that of FBIOX. These differences can affect any metric (although some might not be present for FBIOX, since it's a mutual fund) as well as performance. For example, FBIOX includes Ironwood Pharmaceuticals (IRWD) in its top 10 holdings, while IBB doesn't. Although IBB does include IRWD because it's a major NASDAQ biotech stock, the difference in holdings is important for an industry where investors' perception of a stock can hinge on a single drug approval. This is a factor even for established companies. In general, I want to emphasize that a) funds that invest more heavily in small-cap biotech stocks may exhibit higher P\/E ratios for the reasons stated above, and b) even funds with similar mixes of stocks may have somewhat different performance because of the nature of risk in the biotech industry. There are also funds like Vanguard's Healthcare ETF (VHT) that have significant exposure to the biotech industry, including small-cap firms, but also to major players in the pharmaceutical market like Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson, etc. Since buyouts of small-cap companies by large players are a major factor in the biotech industry, these funds may exhibit different financial statistics because they reflect both the high prices\/low earnings of young companies and the more standard prices\/established earnings of larger companies.  Don't interpret anything I stated above as investment advice; I don't want anything I say to be construed as any form of investment recommendation, since I'm not making one.","instruction":"Offer your insights or judgment on the input financial query or topic using your financial expertise.

{"input":"Why invest in becoming a landlord?","output":"The value of getting into the landlord business -- or any other business -- depends on circumstances at the time. How much will it cost you to buy the property? How much can you reasonably expect to collect in rent? How easy or difficult is it to find a tenant? Etc. I owned a rental property for about ten years and I lost a bundle of money on it. Things people often don't consider when calculating likely rental income are: There will be times when you have no tenant. Someone moves out and you don't always find a new tenant right away. Maintenance. There's always something that the tenant expects you to fix. Tenants aren't likely to take as good a care of the property as someone who owned it would. And while a homeowner might fix little things himself, like a broken light switch or doorknob, the tenant expects the landlord to fix such things. If you live nearby and have the time and ability to do minor maintenance, this may be no big deal. If you have to call a professional, this can get very expensive very quickly. Like for example, I once had a tenant complain that the water heater wasn't working. I called a plumber. He found that the knob on the water heater was set to \"low\". So he turned it up. He charged me, I think it was $200. I can't really complain about the charge. He had to drive to the property, figure out that that was all the problem was, turn the knob, and then verify that that really solved the problem. Tenants don't always pay the rent on time, or at all. I had several tenants who apparently saw the rent as something optional, to be paid if they had money left over that they couldn't think of anything better to do with. You may get bad tenants who destroy the place. I had one tenant who did $10,000 worth of damage. That include six inches deep of trash all over the house that had to be cleared out, rotting food all over, excrement smeared on walls, holes in the walls, and many things broken. I thought it was disgusting just to have to go in to clean it up, I can't imagine living like that, but whatever. Depending on the laws in your area, it may be very difficult to kick out a bad tenant. In my case, I had to evict two tenants, and it took about three months each time to go through the legal process. On the slip side, the big advantage to owning real estate is that once you pay it off, you own it and can continue to collect rent. And as most currencies in the world are subject to inflation, the rent you can charge will normally go up while your mortgage payments are constant.","instruction":"Based on your financial expertise, provide your response or viewpoint on the given financial question or topic.

The amount of money they owe is large compared to their yearly income. Consider a metaphor.  I put you in a hole.  Its only 1 foot deep.  You're not too concerned.  If you want to leave, you can step out of it.  Now we look at a deeper hole, 3 feet.  Now you're still not too concerned.  You can't just walk out, but if you need to get out you can wiggle your way up.  6 feet.  Now you start getting nervous.  Climbing out is getting trickier and trickier.  You may not be able to move in response to a changing enviornment around you, because you're stuck in a hole. Now make the hole 10 feet.  Now you can't reach the edges.  Now you're in trouble.  You have lost all mobility.  You can't get out under your own power.  Now if something bad happens (such as losing your job or a sudden health issue), you can't move around to solve the problem. This is the issue that arise from underwater mortgages.  Say you lose your job because the job market in your area dried up (think Detroit in the big auto manufacturer crash).  You need to move.  You are legally endebted to a lender for your existing underwater house by more than you can sell it for.  You need to pay for the privilege to sell it.  You still owe payments on it, so if you just buy a new house (or rent) in the new state, you're paying for twice as much property.  You can't just shuffle the underwaterness from your old house to your new house because the new lender has no interest in giving a loan for more than the value of the new home. The only options you have to play with is renting the old house, which many underwater families did, or bankrupcy.  If the area you were in is depressed, you may not be able to rent the house for enough to cover your mortgage.  This is the fear of being underwater.  You have a piece of paper which claims some lender can take money from you that you may or may not have, and that the US government will allow them to take your assets, if need be, to settle the score. If you're underwater by a few thousand, it's typically not a big deal.  If you're underwater by 80 or 90 thousand dollars, which some people were, that's a lot of money to be endebted for without the assets to recover them. If you subscribe to the realtor story that the market will recover, all you have to do is scrape by, holding on, until the market rises again.  However, those who are underwater recognize that the reason much of this occurred is that we entered a bubble because realtors kept saying the market could only go up.

{"input":"Is keeping track of your money and having a budget the same thing?","output":"What you are doing is neither one.  You are simply watching to make sure you don't overdraw, which itself suggests you might be living hand to mouth and not saving.  Keeping track of your money and budgeting are useful tools which help people get on top of their money.  Which tends to have the effect of allowing you to save.   How much did you spend on groceries last month? Eating out? Gas? If you were \"keeping track of your money\", you could say immediately what you spent, and whether that is above or below average, and why.  How much do you plan to spend in the next 3 months on gas, groceries, eating out?  If you knew the answer to that question, then you would have a \"budget\".   And if those months go by, and your budget proves to have been accurate, or educates you as to what went wrong so you can learn and fix it... then your budget is a functioning document that is helping you master your money.  Certainly the more powerful of the two is the \"keeping track\", or accounting of what has happened to you so far.   It's important that you keep track of every penny without letting stuff \"slip through the cracks\".   Here you can use proper accounting techniques and maybe accounting software, just like businesses do where they reconcile their accounting against their bank statements and wallet cash. I shortcut that a little.  I buy gift cards for McDonalds, Panera, Starbucks, etc. and buy my meals with those.  That way, I only have one transaction to log, $40 - McDonalds gift card instead of a dozen little meals.  It works perfectly fine since I know all that money went to fast food.  A little more dangerous is that I treat wallet cash the same way, logging say two monthly entries of $100 to cash rather than 50 little transactions of left $1 tip at restaurant.  This only works because cash is a tiny part of my overall expenditures - not worth accounting.  If it added up to a significant part, I'd want accounting on that.","instruction":"Offer your insights or judgment on the input financial query or topic using your financial expertise.

{"input":"How to know if I can have NOL (U.S. tax)?","output":"Individuals most definitely can have NOL. This is covered in the IRS publication 536. What is the difference between NOL and capital loss? NOL is Net Operating Loss. I.e.: a situation where your (allowable) expenses and deductions exceed your gross income. Basically it means that you have negative income for that year, for tax purposes. Capital loss occurs when the total amount of your capital gains reported on Schedule D is negative. What are their relations then? Not all expenses and deductions that you usually put on your tax return are allowed for NOL calculation. For example, capital loss is not allowed. I.e.: if you earned $2000 and you lost in stocks $3000 - you do not get a $1K NOL. Capital losses are excluded from NOL calculation and in this scenario you still have non-negative income for NOL purposes even though it is offset in full by capital loss deduction and your \"taxable income\" line is negative. The $1K that was not allowed - gets carried forward to the next year using the Capital Loss Carryover Worksheet in the instructions to Schedule D. You calculate your NOL using form 1045 schedule A. You can use the form 1045 to apply the NOL to prior 2 years, or you can elect to apply it only to future years (up to 20 years). In what cases, capital loss can be NOL? Never.","instruction":"Offer your insights or judgment on the input financial query or topic using your financial expertise. Reply as normal question answering"}

But otherwise, some companies today trading at an astronimical price, and which nevers pays a dividend- chalk it up to market stupidity.

Businesses don't offer 0% credit for free, and they don't lose money on the deal.  When you shop at a store that offers 0% credit, you are generally overpaying for the item.  By shopping at a store that does not offer 0% credit, you might be able to get a better price. Your savings account is likely earning very little interest.  You might invest the money you intend for your purchases in a place that gets better returns, but in most of these places the returns are not guaranteed, and you might not do as well as you think. 0% loans typically come with lots of conditions that have very heavy penalties and interest rate hikes for late payments.  You can mitigate this risk by setting up automatic payments, but things can still go wrong.  Your bank might change your account number, making the automated payment fail.  As you mentioned, you might also forget to put the proper amount of money in the account.  A single mistake can negate all of the tiny gains you are trying to achieve. Ultimately, the decision is yours, of course, but in my opinion, there is very, very little to gain with buying something on 0% credit when you could be paying cash.","instruction":"Utilize your financial knowledge, give your answer or opinion to the input question or subject .

{"input":"What drives the stock of bankrupt companies?","output":"What drives the stock of bankrupt companies? Such stock is typically considered \"distressed assets\".  Technically, what drives it is what drives every stock - supply and demand. A more interesting question is of course, why would there be demand? First, who exerts the buying pressure on the stock? Typically, three types of entities: The largest ones are financial institutions specializing in distressed assets (frequently, alternatives specialists - hedge funds, private equity firms etc...). Usually, they invest in distressed debt or distressed preferred equity; but sometimes distressed equity as well. Why? We will discuss their motivations separately in this answer. Second one are existing equity holders.  Why? Short answer, behavioral psychology and behavioral economics. Many investors - especially non-professionals - insist on holding distressed stocks due to variety of investment fallacies (sunk cost etc...); usually constructing elaborate theories of why and how the company and the stock will recover Sometimes, people who buy into penny stock scams, pump and dump schemes etc... Why? \"There's a sucker born every minute.\" - P.T. Barnum Let's find out why an investment professional would invest in distressed equity? First, the general process is always the same. Company's assets are used to pay off its liabilities; in accordance with applicable law. There are two ways this can be done - either through selling the company; OR through bankruptcy process. The liabilities are paid according to seniority. The seniority priorities rules are covered by 11 U.S. Code \u00a7 507 - Priorities A company in bankruptcy can have one of 2 outcomes: Buyout. Some buyer might decide that the company's assets are worth something to them as a whole; and buy the whole enterprise; rather than risk it being destroyed piecemeal in bankruptcy proceedings. In that case, the proceeds from the sale will be used to fund the liabilities as discussed above. This option is one of the possible reasons people might consider investing in distressed equity.  For example, if the company is in bankruptcy because it can't get enough financing right now, but is likely to have good profits in the future. The chances are, some buyer will buy it for a premium that includes those future profits; and that sale amount might possibly exceed the liabilities. Bankruptcy. The assets are sold and liabilities are covered according to priorities. In that case, the investors in distressed equity might be hoping that there are un-obvious assets whose value would also put the total assets above claimed liabilities. Additional possible beneficial factor is that unsecured debtors must file with the court in order to be paid; and the claim must be validated. Some might fail on either count; so total amount of liabilities might lessen once the bankruptcy process goes through. Assets Now, here's where things get interesting. Of course, companies have usual assets. Real estate, inventory, plants, cash, etc... These are all able to be sold to cover liabilities, and at first glance are possibly not enough to cover liabilities, leaving equity holders with nothing (and even that's not a certainty - bankruptcy is simply inability to service debt payments; and while it correlates to assetsliquid assets, not full asset valuation). But some assets are less sure, and are thus rarely included in such calculations. These may include: Chances of winning appeals if specific existing liabilities are results of litigation, e.g. tax appeals, court judgement appeals etc... Clawbacks and lawsuits against former executives, especially in cases where the company's financial distress resulted from executive malfeasance. I was personally involved in one such case as an equity holder, where the company assets were valued at $X; had liabilities of $X*2; but had a real possibility of winning about $X*3 in a lawsuit against former CEO accused of various malfeasance including fraud and insider trading. As such, the best case scenario was literally 100% profit on holding that distressed equity.","instruction":"Utilize your financial knowledge, give your answer or opinion to the input question or subject .

{"input":"What is the tax liability from an inheritance from a trust and reported on a K-1 form?","output":"You don't need to submit a K-1 form to anyone, but you will need to transcribe various entries on the K-1 form that you will receive onto the appropriate lines on your tax return.  Broadly speaking, assets received as a bequest from someone are not taxable income to you but any money that was received by your grandmother's estate between the time of death and the time of distribution of the assets (e.g. interest, mutual fund distributions paid in cash, etc) might be passed on to you in full instead of the estate paying income tax on this income and sending you only the remainder. If so, this other money would be taxable income to you.  The good news is that if the estate trust distributions include stock, your basis for the stock is the value as of the date of death (nitpickers: I am aware that the estate is allowed to pick a different date for the valuation but I am trying to keep it simple here).  That is, if the stock has appreciated, your grandmother never paid capital gains on those unrealized capital gains, and you don't have to pay tax on those capital gains either; your basis is the appreciated value and if and when you sell the stock, you pay tax only on the gain, if any, between the day that Grandma passed away and the day you sell the stock.","instruction":"Utilize your financial knowledge, give your answer or opinion to the input question or subject .

{"input":"How to account for Capital Gains (Losses) in double-entry accounting?","output":"Capital is an Asset. Decreasing value of capital is the decreasing value of an asset. When you buy the forex asset * DR Forex Asset * CR Cash When you sell * DR Cash  * CR Forex Asset The difference is now accounted for Here is how: Gains (and losses) are modifications to your financial position (Balance sheet). At the end of the period you take your financial performance (Profit and Loss) and put it into your balance sheet under equity. Meaning that afterwards your balance sheet is better or worse off (Because you made more money = more cash or lost it, whatever). You are wanting to make an income account to reflect the forex revaluation so at the end of the period it is reflected in profit then pushed into your balance sheet. Capital gains directly affect your balance sheet because they increase\/decrease your cash and your asset in the journal entry itself (When you buy and sell it). If making money this way is actually how you make you make an income it is possible to make an account for it. If you do this you periodically revalue the asset and write off the changes to the revaluation account. You would do something like *DR Asset *CR Forex Revaluation account; depending on the method you take. Businesses mostly do this because if the capital gains are their line of business they will be taxed on it like it is income. For simplicity just account for it when you buy and sell the assets (Because you as an individual will only recognise a profit\/loss when you enter and exit). Its easier to think about income and expenses are extensions of equity. Income increases your equity, expenses decrease it. This is how they relate to the accounting formula (Assets = Liabilities + Owners Equity)","instruction":"Offer your thoughts or opinion on the input financial query or topic using your financial background."}
{"input":"Gap in domestic Health Insurance coverage, expect higher premiums?","output":"The insurance company is must assume you do have a preexisting condition you are unaware of.  The reason for that is that Affordable Care Act precludes the Insurance company from denying coverage of them if you do.  Insurance companies are businesses.  They are in business to make money(unless you have a nonprofit insurer).  They can not do that if you can buy insurance only when you need for them to pay out.  So even though you may not have a preexisting condition, they are precluded from requiring an examination that would detect the most expensive preexisting conditions (hidden cancers, neurological, autoimmune disorders).  So the companies must do what takes business sense and either deny you coverage or charge a rate that covers the risk they would be forced to take.   In your question on travel there was a response that suggested you get international health insurance instead of travel health insurance that would be considered credible coverage.  You are trying to save money which on a personal level is a good idea.  However that is against the societal and business need that you maintain health coverage during your healthy times to cover the costs of those who need expensive treatment.  So you will be monetarily penalized should you choose to reenter the society of insured people.  Once you have paid the higher rate for up to 18 months you should be able to get a better policy for people who have had continuous coverage.  Alternately you may be lucky enough to start working for a company that provides health insurance with out requiring continuous coverage.","instruction":"Offer your insights or judgment on the input financial query or topic using your financial expertise.

There are generally a couple of different schools of analysis that may be worth passing along: Fundamental Analysis:Fundamental analysis of a business involves analyzing its financial statements and health, its management and competitive advantages, and its competitors and markets. When applied to futures and forex, it focuses on the overall state of the economy, interest rates, production, earnings, and management. When analyzing a stock, futures contract, or currency using fundamental analysis there are two basic approaches one can use; bottom up analysis and top down analysis. The term is used to distinguish such analysis from other types of investment analysis, such as quantitative analysis and technical analysis. Technical Analysis:In finance, technical analysis is a security analysis methodology for forecasting the direction of prices through the study of past market data, primarily price and volume. Behavioral economics and quantitative analysis use many of the same tools of technical analysis, which, being an aspect of active management, stands in contradiction to much of modern portfolio theory. The efficacy of both technical and fundamental analysis is disputed by the efficient-market hypothesis which states that stock market prices are essentially unpredictable. There are tools like \"Stock Screeners\" that will let you filter based on various criteria to use each analysis in a mix.  There are various strategies one could use.  Wikipedia under Stock Speculator lists: \"Several different types of stock trading strategies or approaches exist including day trading, trend following, market making, scalping (trading), momentum trading, trading the news, and arbitrage.\"  Thus, I'd advise research what approach are you wanting to use as the \"Make it up as we go along losing real money all the way\" wouldn't be my suggested approach. There is something to be said for there being numerous columnists and newsletter peddlers if you want other ideas but I would suggest having a strategy before putting one's toe in the water.","instruction":"Offer your insights or judgment on the input financial query or topic using your financial expertise.

{"input":"Is a \u201ctotal stock market\u201d index fund diverse enough alone?","output":"Brendan, The short answer is no, there is no need to get into any other funds. For all intents and purposes the S&P 500 is \"The Stock Market\". The news media may quote the Dow when the market reaches new highs or crashes but all of the Dow 30 stocks are included in the S&P 500.  The S&P is also marketcap weighted, which means that it owns in higher proportion the big \"Blue Chip\" stocks more than the smaller less known companies. To explain, the top 10 holdings in the S&P represent 18% of the total index, while the bottom 10 only represent 0.17% (less than 1 percent). They do have an equal weighted S&P in which all 500 companies represent only 1\/500th of the index and that is technically even more diversified but in actuality it makes it more volatile because it has a higher concentration of those smaller less known companies. So it will tend to perform better during up markets and worse during down markets. As far as diversification into different asset classes or other countries, that's non-sense. The S&P 500 has companies in it that give you that exposure. For example, it includes companies that directly benefit from rising oil prices, rising gold prices, etc known as the Energy and Materials sector. It also includes companies that own malls, apartment complexes, etc. known as the Real Estate sector. And as far as other countries, most of the companies in the S&P are multi-national companies, meaning that they do business over seas in many parts of the world. Apple and FaceBook for example sell their products in many different countries. So you don't need to invest any of your money into an Emerging Market fund or an Asia Fund because most of our companies are already doing business in those parts of the world. Likewise, you don't need to specifically invest into a real estate or gold fund.  As far as bonds go, if you're in your twenties you have no need for them either. Why, because the S&P 500 also pays you dividends and these dividends grow over time. So for example, if Microsoft increases its dividend payment by 100% over a ten year period , all of the shares you buy today at a 2.5% yield will, in 10 years, have a higher 5% yield. A bond on the other hand will never increase its yield over time. If it pays out 4%, that's all it will ever pay. You want to invest because you want to grow your money and if you want to invest passively the fastest way to do that is through index ETFs like the $SPY, $IVV, and $RSP. Also look into the $XIV, it's an inverse VIX ETF, it moves 5x faster than the S&P in the same direction. If you want to actively trade your money, you can grow it even faster by getting into things like options, highly volatile penny stocks, shorting stocks, and futures. Don't get involved in FX or currency trading, unless it through futures.","instruction":"Offer your thoughts or opinion on the input financial query or topic using your financial background."}
{"input":"Should I remodel or buy a bigger house?","output":"I am quite sure you can set up an office in your basement for a lot less than $15,000. Don't build any walls, install any flooring, or upgrade the ceiling. Just install more lights and plugs. Set up your desks, bookshelves and what not in whatever corner is furthest from noises like the laundry room or the furnace. The kids and the nanny get the main floor - just let the whole living room be a giant playroom, for example. This gives you the separation you need to work at home, but you can hear if something really needs your attention.  When the kids go off to school, you can refinish the basement into a playroom for kids who don't always need supervision, using the money you are no longer spending on the nanny to install carpeting, real walls, a drop ceiling and so on. Your office stuff can move up to the main floor or to a spare room upstairs if you had one but it wasn't usable during the baby years when upstairs generally has to be quiet. As the kids get older the basement can get tailored to what preteens and teens like. This is essentially what we did, and our square footages and child counts match yours almost precisely. We did eventually convert our garage to carpeted and finished space, and it spent time as an office with staff coming in each day, then some time as a teen playroom (think video games and loud music) after the business rented office space outside the house, but if you don't intend to hire staff for your business you don't need to do this part. We did the majority of the basement wiring ourselves and got an electrician to hook it into the panel and check our work.

{"input":"Townhouse or stand-alone house for a first home?","output":"First, some general advice that I think you should consider A good rule of thumb on home buying is to wait to buy until you expect to live in the same place for at least 5 years. This period of time is meant to reduce the impact of closing costs, which can be 1-5% of your total buying & selling price. If you bought and sold in the same year, for example, then you might need to pay over 5% of the value of your home to realtors & lawyers! This means that for many people, it is unwise to buy a home expecting it to be your 'starter' home, if you already are thinking about what your next (presumably bigger) home will look like. If you buy a townhouse expecting to sell it in 3 years to buy a house, you are partially gambling on the chance that increases in your townhome's value will offset the closing costs & mortgage interest paid. Increases in home value are not a sure thing. In many areas, the total costs of home ownership are about equivalent to the total costs of renting, when you factor in maintenance. I notice you don't even mention renting as an option - make sure you at least consider it, before deciding to buy! Also, don't buy a house expecting your life situation to 'make up the difference' in your budget. If you're expecting your girlfriend to move in with you in a year, that implies that you aren't living together now, and maybe haven't talked about it. Even if she says now that she would move in within a year, there's no guarantee that things work out that way. Taking on a mortgage is a commitment that you need to take on yourself; no one else will be liable for the payments. As for whether a townhouse or a detached house helps you meet your needs better, don't get caught up in terminology. There are few differences between houses & townhomes that are universal. Stereotypically townhomes are cheaper, smaller, noisier, and have condo associations with monthly fees to pay for maintenance on joint property. But that is something that differs on a case-by-case basis. Don't get tricked into buying a 1,100 sq ft house with a restrictive HOA, instead of a 1,400 sq ft free-hold townhouse, just because townhouses have a certain reputation. The only true difference between a house and a townhouse is that 1 or both of your walls are shared with a neighbor. Everything else is flexible.","instruction":"Offer your insights or judgment on the input financial query or topic using your financial expertise. Reply as normal question answering"}

{"input":"Rolled over husband's 401(k) to IRA after his death. Can I deduct a loss since?","output":"First: In most cases when you inherit stocks the cost basis is stepped up to the date of the death of the person you inherited them from. So the capital gain\/loss is likely reset to zero. The rules vary a bit for joint accounts, but retirement accounts (401k\/ROTH) are considered individual accounts by the IRS. The rules on this have changed a lot in recent history, so it may depend on when he died. Update: As JoeTaxpayer pointed out and I confirmed via this site , the gains are NOT stepped up for retirement accounts, so this is a moot point anyway.  Further evidence that retirement accounts can be complicated and seeking professional guidance is a good idea. ...[T]here is no step-up in cost basis   upon the death of the IRA owner. Most   other assets owned by an individual   receive a step-up in cost basis upon   the death of the person, eliminating   all capital gains on those assets up   to that point in time. Second:  Even if you can deduct an investment (capital) loss, you can only deduct it to offset capital gains on another investments. Also you can only do this up to $3k per year, though you can roll over excess capital losses into future years. Bottom line: I really doubt you are going to be able to claim a deduction. However, due to the complexity of the situation and the amount of money involved.

{"input":"Index ETF or Index mutual fund - standard brokerage account","output":"The main difference between a mutual fund and an ETF are how they are bought and sold (from the investors perspective). An ETF is transacted on the open market. This means you normally can't buy partial shares with your initial investment. Having to transact on the open market also means you pay a market price. The market price is always a little bit different from the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the fund. During market hours, the ETF will trade at a premium\/discount to the NAV calculated on the previous day. Morningstar's fund analysis will show a graph of the premium\/discount to NAV for an ETF. With a mutual fund on the other hand, your investment goes to a fund company, which then grants you shares while under the hood buying the underlying investments. You pay the NAV price and are allowed to buy partial shares. Usually an ETF has a lower expense ratio, but if that's equal and any initial fees\/commissions are equal, I would prefer the mutual fund in order to buy partial shares (so your initial investment will be fully invested) and so you don't have to worry about paying premium to NAV","instruction":"Share your insights or perspective on the financial matter presented in the input."}

Risks and returns are averaged across the real estate portfolio and managed by experts, possibly industry leading experts.  REITs have a well documented track record you can research - most individuals do not. Many individuals have learned a hard lesson or two while attempting to generate passive income with real estate. Conversely, some people derive a great deal of satisfaction from owning real estate and have a true passion to do so.  Plus, if you are expecting interest rates to raise and\/or rate of inflation to increase in the next 30 years, you may benefit from the financing aspects of the investment as well.  There are some regions\/ opportunities that seem to do better than the average REIT a majority of the time, but may not be desirable to you or fit into your budget for various reasons. I'm not sure what your level of experience, knowledge or financial situation , but for everyone considering, there are many additional things to know about investment property compared to a primary residence.

To know when to do this is very easy. If it is currently rising you can put a trailing stop loss on it and sell it when it drops and hits your stop loss. A second easy method is to draw an uptrend line under the increasing price and then sell when the price drops down below the uptrend line, as per the chart below.  This will enable you to capture the bulk of the price movement upward and sell before the price drops too far down. You can then use the profits (after tax) to pay down your mortgage.

Only one of those (maybe one and a half) is related to current  sales, and not always directly. Short-term motion of a stock is even less directly linked, since it also reflects previous expectations. A company can announce disappointing sales and see its stock go up, if the previous price was based on expecting  worse news.","instruction":"Offer your insights or judgment on the input financial query or topic using your financial expertise.

{"input":"When a stock price goes down, does the money just disappears into thin air?","output":"At any given time there are buy orders and there are sell orders.  Typically there is a little bit of space between the lowest sell order and the highest buy order, this is known as the bid\/ask spread.  As an example say person A will sell for $10.10 but person B will only buy at $10.00.  If you have a billion shares outstanding just the space between the bid and ask prices represents $100,000,000 of market cap. Now imagine that the CEO is in the news related to some embezzlement investigation.  A number of buyers cancel their orders.  Now the highest buy order is $7.  There isn't money involved, that's just the highest offer to buy at the time; but that's a drop from $10 to $7.  That's a change in market cap of $3,000,000,000.  Some seller thinks the stock will continue to fall, and some buyer thinks the stock has reached a fair enterprise value at $7 billion ($7 per share).  Whether or not the seller lost money depends on where the seller bought the stock.  Maybe they bought when it was an IPO for $1.  Even at $7 they made $6 per share. Value is changing, not money.

I already know that I bought gasoline from the station down the street, a slip of paper whose date may or may not align with the credit card bill is not very useful. The half-life for a stolen card is hours. So you tend to see a bunch of charges appearing quickly.

As a result, he ended up paying triple what the car was worth, because of the interest. When we consolidated our finances, this ugly loan was first on our list of priorities to change, convert, eliminate, but unfortunately, in our case, the terms of the loan were such that only the lender benefited.  There was no incentive to pay off the loan early, in fact, we would have to have paid all the future interest at once, without saving a penny. So check the terms of your loan - hopefully you're better off than we were.

And as @JoeTaxpayer has confirmed, you still get to deduct the current value of the donation, not just the basis value of those shares. So if you're donating anyway, this comes close to being Free Money in exchange for some slightly annoying paperwork. (Yet another benefit of long-term investing!)

{"input":"Are PINs always needed for paying with card?","output":"Like email and spam, fighting creditcard fraud is a cat and mouse game, with technology and processes constantly being developed to reduce fraud. The CVV on the back of the card is just one more layer of security.  Requiring the CVV generally requires you to physically have access to the card. CVV should not be stored by any merchant. This frustrates card skimming fraud as the CVV is not present in the track data and fraud caused by database compromises.  You should never use your PIN online. MC\/VISA both have implementations of 3D-Secure (SecureCode for MC and Verified by VISA) which require a password \/ code to confirm card ownership. Depends on both Issuer and Merchant implementing the standard.  Regarding not needing a PIN at the airport, some low value transactions no longer need PINs, depending on the Issuer and Scheme (VISA\/MC). MasterCard PayPass or VISA PayWave enable low value contactless transactions without PIN. In Australia, the maximum value for a contactless transactions is $100 AUD. At some merchants (McDonalds for example) a PIN is not required for for meals purchased with VISA (at least, for the cheeseburger I bought there as a test). This makes sense - if you don't need a PIN for a contactless purchase, why do you need it for a chip based purchase?  So - why allow PIN free transactions? On average customers report stolen credit cards \/ wallet very quickly and the losses are correspondingly small. As card issuers are always online, cards can be cancelled very quickly after being reported lost \/ stolen. Finally, by performing transactions for just a few cents or pennies, the merchant (Spotify) can likely validate you are the owner of the card as you'd need access to your online bank to confirm the transactions.  PayPal do this with bank account to confirm ownership.

{"input":"Can individuals day-trade stocks using High-Frequency Trading (HFT)?","output":"The answer is to your question is somewhat complicated. You will be unable to compete with the firms traditionally associated with High Frequency Trading in any of their strategies. Most of these strategies which involve marketing making, latency arbitrage, and rebate collection. The amount of engineering required to build the infrastructure required to run this at scale makes it something which can only be undertaken by a team of highly skilled engineers. Indeed, the advantage of firms competing in this space such as TradeBot, TradeWorx, and Getco comes from this infrastructure as most of the strategies that are developed are necessarily simple due to the latency requirements. Now if you expand the definition of HFT to include all computerized automated trading you most certainly can build strategies that are profitable. It is not something that you probably want to tackle on your own but I know of a couple of people that did go it alone successfully for a couple of years before joining an established firm to run a book for them. In order to be successful you will most likely need to develop a unique strategies. The good news is because that you are trying to deploy a very tiny amount of capital you can engage in trades that larger firms would not because the strategies cannot hold enough capital relative to the firms capital base.  I am the co-founder of a small trading firm that successfully trades the US Equities and Equity Derivatives markets. A couple of things to note is that if you want to do this you should consider building a real business. Having some more smart brains around you will help. You don't need exchange colocation for all strategies. Many firms, including ours, colocate in a data center that simply has proximity to the exchanges data centers. You will need to keep things simple to be effective.  Don't except all the group think that this is impossible. It is possible although as a single individual it will be more difficult.

{"input":"How to share income after marriage and kids?","output":"This would be my suggestion: I would approach the problem thinking about the loss of monthly income you (as a couple) will be facing due to your wife's change to a part time job and divide that loss between the two of you. This means that if she goes from 2200 to 1100 monthly, you'd be losing 1100 per month.  To share this loss, you could repay your wife your part of the loss (550) so both of you are 550 euro down. However, this 550 loss is a bigger burden for your wife than it is for you, so this amount could be adjusted to make up for this inequality.  To make calculations simple and avoid developing a complicated model, you could give the 800 euro above your 3k to your wife for as long as she has to work part time.","instruction":"Offer your thoughts or opinion on the input financial query or topic using your financial background."}

(And both spend the money needed to keep the business up-to-date, that's before profits are calculated).  You are right that with company B, the company will grow. So if you had $1000 shares in each company, after 20 years company A has given you $1000 in dividends and is worth $1000, while company B has given you no dividends, but is worth a lot more than $2000, $2653 if my calculation is right. Which looks a lot better than company A.

This happened, for example, to the fund Madoff was managing. This is generally a sign of a Ponzi scheme or embezzlement. How can you ensure the funds you invest in are not affected by this? You'll have to read the fund reports, check the independent auditors' reports and check for clues. Generally, this is the job of the SEC - that's what they do as regulators.

{"input":"collateralized mortgage obligations","output":"Actually, you're missing the key feature of CDOs.  Most CDOs use (much to our economic misery, ultimately) a system call tranching.  To simplify this idea, I'll make a two tranch example.  Suppose I buy mortgages covering a face value of $120,000,000.  Because they are subprime, if I just put them in a pool and finance them with bonds, the rating will be lousy and most investors will shun them (at least investors who are safety oriented).  What I do is divide them into two tranches.  One bond issue is for $100,000,000 and another for $20,000,000.  The idea is that any defaulting mortgage comes out of the latter bond issue.  I'll probably keep these bonds (the lower tranch).  Thus buyers of the first issue are safe unless defaults exceed $20,000,000.  Then the rating agencies rate the first issue AAA and it gets snapped up by investors.  In a strict sense it is overcollateralized, basically the entire $120,000,000 backs up the first bond issue. In reality, many CDOs had multiple tranches, with the lowest tranch being retained by the underwriters and the other tranches sold as bonds of various ratings.","instruction":"Share your insights or perspective on the financial matter presented in the input."}

{"input":"Company asking for card details to refund over email","output":"A bona-fide company never needs your credit card details, certainly not your 3-digit-on-back-of-card #, to issue a refund.  On an older charge, they might have to work with their merchant provider.  But they should be able to do it within the credit card handling system, and in fact are required to.  Asking for details via email doesn't pass the \"sniff test\" either.  To get a credit card merchant account, a company needs to go through a security assessment process called PCI-DSS. Security gets drummed into you pretty good.  Of course they could be using one of the dumbed-down services like Square, but those services make refunds ridiculously easy.   How did you come to be corresponding on this email address?  Did they initially contact you?  Did you find it on a third party website?  Some of those are fraudulent and many others, like Yelp, it's very easy to insert false contact information for a business. Consumer forums, even moreso.  You might take another swing at finding a proper contact for the company.  Stop asking for a cheque.  That also circumvents the credit card system.  And obviously a scammer won't send a check... at least not one you'd want!  If all else fails: call your bank and tell them you want to do a chargeback on that transaction.  This is where the bank intervenes to reverse the charge.  It's rather straightforward (especially if the merchant has agreed in principle to a refund) but requires some paperwork or e-paperwork.   Don't chargeback lightly.  Don't use it casually or out of laziness or unwillingness to speak with the merchant, e.g. to cancel an order.  The bank charges the merchant a $20 or larger investigation fee, separate from the refund.  Each chargeback is also a \"strike\"; too many \"strikes\" and the merchant is barred from taking credit cards. It's serious business.   As a merchant, I would never send a cheque to an angry customer.  Because if I did, they'd cash the cheque and still do a chargeback, so then I'd be out the money twice, plus the investigation fee to boot.","instruction":"Utilize your financial knowledge, give your answer or opinion to the input question or subject .

{"input":"Disputing Items to Improve Credit Report","output":"A few points: The reason your lender is asking you to be above 580 is because that is the magic number for an FHA loan where your down payment would be only 3.5% (the US Government effectively subsidizes the rest of your down pmt). If you had a score lower than that (but still above 500), you will need to put 10% down which is still less than the typical 20% down pmt that many of us make. It's not that you can't get a loan with a score < 580. It's that you don't qualify for the \"maximum financing\" thru FHA. You should do some research and decide if you even want an FHA loan. And keep in mind, you will throw away some money every month towards PMI (mortgage insurance) if you do FHA. Many insist on 20% down pmt to avoid that. How exactly these two items will effect your score is another question. It's possible that having accounts added back as revolving accounts could negatively \/ not positively effect it. It will likely effect it in some way and I'm not 100% which way or if it would be very significant. You may want to dispute both of those items regardless if you can't afford anything but an FHA loan. If that's the case, then you may have nothing to lose. You might also want to shop around for mortgage lenders. And look for a \"portfolio lender.\" These type of lenders general have more flexibility in who they can lend to and the type of loans.","instruction":"Utilize your financial knowledge, give your answer or opinion to the input question or subject .

{"input":"Difference between IRR and ROR","output":"There may be differences in different contexts, but here's my general understanding: Rate of Return (or Return on Investment) is the total gain or loss of an investment divided by the initial investment amount.  e.g. if you buy stock for $100 and later sell it for $120 you have a 20% Rate of Return.  You would have a 20% ROR regardless of if you sell it tomorrow or in a year. Internal Rate of Return is effectively annualized.  It is the annual rate at which each of a series of cashflows is discounted that would give you a net present value of 0.  Meaning if you spent $100 today and in exactly one year you received $120 back, you would have an IRR of 20%.  If you received the $120 back in 6 months, your IRR would be roughly 40%. An IRR calculation can include multiple cashflows at various times, while ROR is (in my mind) the total net gain or loss relative to the investment (irrespective of the time of the cash flows). IRR is more effective when comparing investments that have different time horizons.  Spending $100 to get $120 tomorrow is much better (from an IRR perspective) than getting $120 two years from now, since you could take that $20 gain and invest it for the rest of the two years.","instruction":"Offer your thoughts or opinion on the input financial query or topic using your financial background."}

{"input":"Is it practical to take actual delivery on a futures contract, and what is the process?","output":"Not all futures contracts are deliverable.  Some futures are specified as cash settlement only. In the case of deliverable contracts, part of the specification of a futures contract will be the delivery locations.  As per my answer to your previous question, please see the CME Rulebook for details of delivery points for the deliverable futures contracts traded on CME, CBOT, NYMEX, and COMEX. Assuming your agreement with your broker allows you to exercise your right to take delivery, your broker will facilitate your delivery.  You will be required to pay the contracted amount (your buy price x contract size x number of lots), as well as a delivery fee, insurance, and warehousing fees.  In addition, your broker may charge you a fee for facilitating the delivery. You will be required to continue to pay insurance and warehousing fees so long as your holding of the underlying commodity is held in the exchange's designated warehouse. If you wish to take delivery yourself by having the commodity removed from the warehouse and delivered to you personally, then you will need to arrange this delivery yourself. Warehouse\/delivery points obviously vary according the contract being exercised. See the CME Rulebook for available delivery points.  Some exchanges are more accommodating than others. The practicality of taking delivery very much depends on your personal circumstances.  An investment bank taking delivery of treasury bonds would be more practical than an individual investor taking delivery of treasury bonds.  This is because the individual investor would be required to deliver the bonds to a brokerage in order to sell them.  In the case of non-financial futures deliveries, it is hard to imagine any circumstance where an individual taking delivery would be practical.","instruction":"Share your insights or perspective on the financial matter presented in the input."}

{"input":"Is there any instance where less leverage will get you a better return on a rental property?","output":"Leverage means you can make more investments with the same amount of money.  In the case of rental properties, it means you can own more properties and generate more rents.  You exchange a higher cost of doing business (higher interest fees) and a higher risk of total failure, for a larger number of rents and thus higher potential earnings. As with any investment advice, whenever someone tells you \"Do X and you are guaranteed to make more money\", unless you are a printer of money that is not entirely true. In this case, taking more leverage exposes you to more risk, while giving you more potential gain.  That risk is not only on the selling front; in fact, for most small property owners, the risk is primarily that you will have periods of time of higher expense or lower income.  These can come in several ways: If you weather these and similar problems, then you will stand to make more money using higher leverage, assuming you make more money from each property than your additional interest costs.  As long as you're making any money on your properties this is likely (as interest rates are very low right now), but making any money at all (above and beyond the sale value) may be challenging early on.   These sorts of risks are magnified for your first few years, until you've built up a significant reserve to keep your business afloat in downturns.  And of course, any money in a reserve is money you're not leveraging for new property acquisition - the very same trade-off.  And while you may be able to sell one or more properties if you did end up in a temporarily bad situation, you also may run into 2008 again and be unable to do so.","instruction":"Utilize your financial knowledge, give your answer or opinion to the input question or subject .

{"input":"Why are there many small banks and more banks in the U.S.?","output":"Wikipedia has a good summary: Historically, branch banking in the United States - especially interstate branch banking - was viewed unfavorably by regulatory authorities, and this was codified with the enactment of the McFadden Act of 1927, which specifically prohibited interstate banking. Over the next few decades, some banks attempted to circumvent McFadden's provisions by establishing bank holding companies that operated so-called independent banks in multiple states. To address this, The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 prohibited bank holding companies headquartered in one state from having branches in any other state. Most interstate banking prohibitions were repealed by the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994. Research has also found that anticompetitive state provisions restricted out-of-state growth when those provisions were more restrictive than the provisions set by the Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act or by neighboring states. Some states have also had restrictive bank branch laws; for example, Illinois outlawed branches (other than the main office) until 1967, and did not allow an unlimited number until 1993.","instruction":"Offer your insights or judgment on the input financial query or topic using your financial expertise.

{"input":"How can this be enough to fund a scholarship in perpetuity?","output":"Some historical and mathematical insights as a complement to existing answers.  History. I found it astonishing that already in Ancient Roman they investigated the issue of perpetuity of 30'000 (almost). Columella writes in De re rustica (3, 3, 7\u201311.) in 1-st century AD about a perpetuity of 32480 sesterces principal under 6% p.a. resulting in 1950 sesterces annual payment. And  if  the  husbandman  would  enter  this  amount  as  a  debt  against his vineyards just as a moneylender does with a debtor,   so that the owner may realize the aforementioned six per cent. interest on that total as a perpetual annuity,  he  should  take  in  1950 sesterces every  year.   By  this  reckoning  the return on seven iugerum, even according to the opinion of Graecinus, exceeds the interest on 32'480 sesterces. Math. If we fix a scholarship at 1'000 a year, then it's clear that it could be paid out infinitely if we could achieve 3.33% p.a. on it.  On the other side, with 0% we'll spend out the endowment in 30 years. Thus, having the interest rate between 0% and 3.33% p.a. we could vary the life of endowment between 30 years and infinity. Just a few numbers in between: under 1%, it would be ~36 years, under 2% ~46 years, under 3% ~78 years (however, 1000$ in 78 years could be less than 10$ today). Conclusion: to keep it perpetual either the fund's yield must be at the level of scholarship, or re-adjust the amount of scholarship depending on fund achievement, or redefine the notion of perpetuity (like 50 years is approximately infinite for our purpose).","instruction":"Offer your insights or judgment on the input financial query or topic using your financial expertise.

{"input":"An online casino owes me money and wants to pay with a wire transfer. Is this safe?","output":"I don't know which online casino we are talking about, but I would venture to say that online casinos, in general, are probably not the most trustworthy of businesses.  Caution is certainly in order.  That having been said, this isn't an e-mail from a stranger that contacted you out of the blue; you obviously trust them enough to have deposited some money with them, and it seems that they now owe you money. Let's assume for the moment that they are legitimate, and that they sincerely want to pay out your winnings.  If they are to pay you via a wire transfer, they would need your account number and routing number.  (This information is on every check that you write.)  In addition, if this is an international transfer, they would also need your bank's SWIFT number, or possibly an IBAN code. It does seem odd that they would pay you a partial payment with a check, but the rest has to be done via a wire transfer.  You could request that they send the remainder as a check, but I would imagine that if they refuse to send you a check, there is nothing you can do about it. If you decide to go ahead with the wire transfer, you could open up a new savings account with your bank first.  Then you could provide the account number for this new account, and if they are intending to clean out your account, there will be nothing in it.  (For extra protection, when you set up the account, you could ask the bank if they can set up a savings account that will accept incoming wire deposits, but no outgoing electronic withdrawals.) Either way, when you deposit the check you have and you receive this wire transfer, don't spend this money for a while.  Just let it sit in your account (you could transfer it to your main account, if you like), and wait a few weeks.  That way, if there is a problem with these payments and your bank insists on the money back, you will not be in trouble.  If they send you more than they owe you and ask for some of it back, it will be a clear indication of a scam.  Don't send them any money back. After a few weeks, you should be in the clear.  Good luck. By the way, online gambling is a terrible idea.  The fact that you don't trust the casino to pay out should tell you a lot about this industry.  After you receive these winnings (or even if you don't), the best advice I can give you is to stop gambling.","instruction":"Based on your financial expertise, provide your response or viewpoint on the given financial question or topic.

{"input":"If I have 10,000 stocks to sell with 23 B market cap","output":"You will almost certainly be able to sell 10,000 shares at once. The question is a matter of price. If you sell \"at market\" then you may get a lower price for each \"batch\" of the stock sold (one person buys 50, another buys 200, another buys 1000 etc) at varying prices. Will you be able to execute a single order to sell them all at the same price at the same time? Nobody can say, and it's not really a function of the company size. The exchange has what's called \"open interest\" which roughly correlates to how many people have active orders in at a given price. This number is constantly changing alongside the bid and ask (particularly for active stocks). So let's say you have 10,000 shares and you want to sell them for $100 each. What you need is at least 10,000 in open interest at $100 bid to execute. By contrast let's say you issue a limit order at $100 for 10,000 shares. Your ask will stay outstanding at that price and you'll be filled at that price if there are enough buyers. I you have a limit sell order at $100 for 10,000 shares the strike price of the stock cannot go to $100.01 until all of your sell orders are filled.","instruction":"Based on your financial expertise, provide your response or viewpoint on the given financial question or topic.

{"input":"Does Joel Greenblatt's \u201cMagic Formula Investing\u201d really beat the market?","output":"I read the book, and I'm willing to believe you'd have a good chance of beating the market with this strategy - it is a reasonable, rational, and mechanical investment discipline. I doubt it's overplayed and overused to the point that it won't ever work again. But only IF you stick to it, and doing so would be very hard (behaviorally). Which is probably why it isn't overplayed and overused already. This strategy makes you place trades in companies you often won't have heard of, with volatile prices. The best way to use the strategy would be to try to get it automated somehow and avoid looking at the individual stocks, I bet, to take your behavior out of it. There may well be some risk factors in this strategy that you don't have in an S&P 500 fund, and those could explain some of the higher returns; for example, a basket of sketchier companies could be more vulnerable to economic events. The strategy won't beat the market every year, either, so that can test your behavior. Strategies tend to work and then stop working (as the book even mentions). This is related to  whether other investors are piling in to the strategy and pushing up prices, in part.  But also, outside events can just happen to line up poorly for a given strategy; for example a bunch of the \"fundamental index\" ETFs that looked at dividend yield launched right before all the high-dividend financials cratered. Investing in high-dividend stocks probably is and was a reasonable strategy in general, but it wasn't a great strategy for a couple years there. Anytime you don't buy the whole market, you risk both positive and negative deviations from it. Here's maybe a bigger-picture point, though. I happen to think \"beating the market\" is a big old distraction for individual investors; what you really want is predictable, adequate returns, who cares if the market returns 20% as long as your returns are adequate, and who cares if you beat the market by 5% if the market cratered 40%. So I'm not a huge fan of investment books that are structured around the topic of beating the market. Whether it's index fund advocates saying \"you can't beat the market so buy the index\" or Greenblatt saying \"here's how to beat the market with this strategy,\" it's still all about beating the market. And to me, beating the market is just irrelevant. Nobody ever bought their food in retirement because they did or did not beat the market. To me, beating the market is a game for the kind of actively-managed mutual fund that has a 90%-plus R-squared correlation with the index; often called an \"index hugger,\" these funds are just trying to eke out a little bit better result than the market, and often get a little bit worse result, and overall are a lot of effort with no purpose. Just get the index fund rather than these. If you're getting active management involved, I'd rather see a big deviation from the index, and I'd like that deviation to be related to risk control: hedging, or pulling back to cash when valuations get rich, or avoiding companies without a \"moat\" and margin of safety, or whatever kind of risk control, but something. In a fund like this, you aren't trying to beat the market, you're trying to increase the chances of adequate returns - you're optimizing for predictability. I'm not sure the magic formula is the best way to do that, focused as it is on beating the market rather than on risk control.

{"input":"How much can I withdraw from Betterment and be considered long-term investment?","output":"This question and your other one indicate you're a bit unclear on how capital gains taxes work, so here's the deal: you buy an asset (like shares of stock or a mutual fund).  You later sell it for more than you bought it for.  You pay taxes on your profit: the difference between what you sold it for and what you bought it for.  What matters is not the amount of money you \"withdraw\", but the prices at which assets are bought and sold. In fact, often you will be able to choose which individual shares you sell, which means you have some control over the tax you pay.  For a simple example, suppose you buy 10 shares of stock for $100 each in January (an investment of $1000); we'll call these the \"early\" shares.  The stock goes up to $200 in July, and you buy 10 more shares (investing an additional $2000); we'll call these the \"late\" shares.  Then the stock drops to $150.  Suppose you want $1500 in cash, so you are going to sell 10 shares. The 10 early shares you bought have increased in value, because you bought then for $100 but can now sell them for $150.  The 10 late shares have decreased in value, because you bought them for $200 but can now only sell them for $150.  If you choose to sell the early shares, you will have a capital gain of $500 ($1500 sale price minus $1000 purchase price), on which you may owe taxes.  If you sell the late shares, you will have a capital loss of $500 ($1500 sale price minus $2000 purchase price is -$500), which you can potentially use to reduce your taxes.  Or you could sell 5 of each and have no gain or loss (selling five early shares for $150 gives you a gain of $250, but selling five late shares for $150 gives you a loss of $250, and they cancel out). The point of all this is to say that the tax is not determined by the amount of cash you get, but by the difference between the sale price and the price you purchased for (known as the \"cost basis\"), and this in turn depends on which specific assets you sell.  It is not enough to know the total amount you invested and the total gain.  You need to know the specific cost basis (i.e., original purchase price) of the specific shares you're selling.  (This is also the answer to your question about long-term versus short-term gains.  It doesn't matter how much money you make on the sale.  What matters is how long you hold the asset before selling it.) That said, many brokers will automatically sell your shares in a certain order unless you tell them otherwise (and some won't let you tell them otherwise).  Often they will use the \"first in, first out\" rule, which means they will always sell the earliest-purchased shares first. To finally get to your specific question about Betterment, they have a page here that says they use a different method.  Essentially, they try to sell your shares in a way that minimizes taxes.  They do this by first selling shares that have a loss, and only then selling shares that have a gain.  This basically means that if you want to cash out $X, and it is possible to do it in a way that incurs no tax liability, they will do that. What gets me very confused is if I continue to invest random amounts of money each month using Betterment, then I need to withdraw some cash, what are the tax implications.  As my long answer above should indicate, there is no simple answer to this.  The answer is \"it depends\".  It depends on exactly when you bought the shares, exactly how much you paid for them, exactly when and how much the price rose or fell, and exactly how much you sell them for.  Betterment is more or less saying \"Don't worry about any of this, trust us, we will handle everything so that your tax is minimized.\" A final note: if you really do want to track the details of your cost basis, Betterment may not be for you, because it is an automated platform that may do a lot of individual trades that a human wouldn't do, and that can make tracking the cost basis yourself very difficult.  Almost the whole point of something like Betterment is that you are supposed to give them your money and forget about these details.","instruction":"Offer your insights or judgment on the input financial query or topic using your financial expertise.

{"input":"Are credit cards not viewed as credit until you miss one payment?","output":"There's a difference between missing a payment and \"carrying a balance\" (making an on-time payments that are less than the full balance due). I have heard mortgage brokers claim that, if you have no other credit history, carrying a small balance here and there on a credit card may improve your score.  (\"Small\" is in relation to your available credit and your ability to pay it off.)  But actually missing a payment will probably hurt your score. Example: You have a card with a credit limit of $1000.  In July you charge $300 worth of stuff.  You get the next statement and it shows the balance due of $300 and a minimum payment of $100. If you pay the entire $300 balance in that cycle, most cards won't charge you any interest.  You are not carrying a balance, so the credit scores may not reflect that you actually took a $300 loan and paid it off. If you instead pay $200, you'll be in good standing (because $200 is greater than the minimum payment).  But you'll be carrying a $100 balance into the next statement cycle.  Plus interest will accrue on that $100.  If you do this regularly, your credit score will probably take into account that you've taken a small loan and made the payments.  For those with no other credit history, this may be an appropriate way to increase your credit score.  (But you're paying interest, so it's not free.)  And if the average balance you carry is considered high relative to your ability to pay or to the total credit available to you, then this could adversely affect your score (or, at least, the amount of credit another provider is willing to extend to you). If you instead actually miss a payment, or make a payment that's less than the minimum payment, that will almost certainly hurt your credit score.  It will also incur penalties as well as interest.  You want to avoid that whenever possible. My guess is that, in the game of telephone from the banker to you, the \"carrying a balance\" was misinterpreted as \"missing a payment.\"","instruction":"Based on your financial expertise, provide your response or viewpoint on the given financial question or topic.

Of course, this totally depends on the company, but it would be advisable to check your company's H.R. policy on that, if you're considering a move (even a lateral one) in the future.","instruction":"Offer your insights or judgment on the input financial query or topic using your financial expertise.

{"input":"Profiting from the PWC Money Tree","output":"The hardest part seems to be knowing exactly when to sell the stock.  Well yes, that's the problem with all stock investing. Reports come out all the time, sometimes even from very smart people with no motivation to lie, about expected earnings for this company, or for that industry. Whether those predictions come true is something you will only find out with time. What you are considering is using financial information available to you (and equally available to the public) to make investment choices. This is called 'fundamental analysis'; that is, the analysis of the fundamentals of a business and what it should be worth. It forms the basis of how many investment firms decide where to put their money.  In a perfectly 'efficient' market, all information available to the public is immediately factored into the market price for that company's stock. ie: if a bank report states with absolute certainty (through leaked documents) that Coca-Cola is going to announce 10% revenue growth tomorrow, then everyone will immediately buy Coca-Cola stock today, and then tomorrow there would be no impact. Even if PwC is 100% accurate in its predictions, if the rest of the market agrees with them, then the price at the time of IPO would equal the future value of the cashflows, meaning there would be no gain unless results surpassed expectations. So what you are proposing is to take one sliver of the information available to the public (have you also read all publicly available reports on those businesses and their industries?), and using that to make a high risk investment. Are you going to do better than the investment firms that have teams of researchers and years of experience in the investment world? You can do quite well by picking individual stocks, but you can also lose a lot of money if you do it haphazardly. Be aware that there is risk in doing any type of investing. There is higher than average risk if you invest in equities ('the stock market'). There is higher risk still, if you pick individual stocks. There is yet even higher risk, if you pick small startup companies.  There are some specific interesting side-elements with your proposal to purchase stock about to have an IPO - those are better dealt with in a separate question if you want more information; search this site for 'IPO' and you should find a good starting point. In short, the company about to go public will hire a firm of analysts who will try to calculate the best price the public will accept for an offering of shares. Stock often goes up after IPO, but not always. Sometimes the company doesn't even fill its full IPO order, adding a new type of risk to a potential investor, that the stock will drop on day 1. Consider an analogy outside the investing world:  Let's say Auto Trader magazine prints an article that says \"all 2015 Honda Civics are worth $15,000 if they have less than 50,000 Miles.\" Assume you have no particular knowledge about cars. If you read this article, and you see an ad in the paper the next day for a Honda Civic with 40k miles, should you buy it for $14k? The answer is not without more research. And even if you determine enough about cars to find one for $14k that you can reasonably sell for $15k, there's a whole world of mechanics out there who buy and sell cars for a living, and they have an edge both because they can repair the cars themselves to sell for more, and also because they have experience to spot low-offers faster than you. And if you pick a clunker (or a stock that doesn't perform even when everyone expected it would), then you could lose some serious money. As with buying and selling individual stocks, there is money to be made from car trading, but that money gets made by people who really know what they're doing. People who go in without full information are the ones who lose money in the long run.","instruction":"Based on your financial expertise, provide your response or viewpoint on the given financial question or topic.

{"input":"What is the US tax owed when gifting India Shares to my brother?","output":"Here's an excerpt from the Charles Schwab website which I think will help evaluate your position: The simple answer to your question is no, the value of a gift of stock   for gift tax liability is NOT the donor's cost basis, but rather the   fair market value of the stock at the time the gift is given. So let's   say you purchased 100 shares of XYZ stock at $50 a share. Your cost   basis is $5,000. Now the stock is $80 a share and you give it as a   gift. The value of your gift for gift tax purposes is $8,000. In 2015, you can give up to $14,000 to an unlimited number of   individuals each year without paying a gift tax or even reporting the   gifts. If you give over that amount to any individual, however, you   must report the gift on your tax return, but you don't have to pay   taxes until you give away more than the current lifetime limit of   $5,430,000\u2014for the amount above and beyond $14,000 per person per   year. So in the example above, there would be no gift tax liability.   However, if the stock happened to be $150 a share, the value of the   gift would be $15,000. You'd then have to report it and $1,000 would   be applied toward your $5,430,000 lifetime exclusion. You will need to pay a gift tax on the current value of the stock. I'm not familiar with the tax laws in India, but if your brother was in the US, he wouldn't pay taxes on that gift until he sells the stock. The recipient doesn\u2019t have to worry about gift taxes. It's when the   recipient decides to sell the stock that the issue of valuation comes   up\u2014for income taxes. And this is where things can get a bit more   complicated. In general, when valuing a gift of stock for capital gains tax   liability, it's the donor's cost basis and holding period that rules.   As an example, let's say you receive a gift of stock from your   grandfather. He bought it for $10 a share and it's worth $15 a share   on the day you receive it. If you then sell the stock, whether for a   gain or a loss, your cost basis will be the same as your   grandfather\u2019s: $10 per share. Sell it at $25 and you'll pay tax (at   the short- or long-term rate, depending on how long he owned the   stock) on a gain of $15 a share; sell it at $8 and your capital loss   will be $2 a share. Ultimately, with a gift this large that also crosses international borders, you really should hire a professional who is experienced with these types of transactions. Their fees\/commission will be completely offset by the savings in risk and paperwork.  http:\/\/www.schwab.com\/public\/schwab\/nn\/articles\/How-Do-You-Value-a-Gift-of-Stock-It-Depends-on-Whether-You-re-the-Giver-or-the-Receiver","instruction":"Offer your insights or judgment on the input financial query or topic using your financial expertise.

{"input":"What return are you getting on your money from paying down a mortgage on a rental property?","output":"As Chris pointed out: If your expenses are covered by the income exactly, as you have said to assume, then you are basically starting with a $40K asset (your starting equity), and ending with a $200K asset (a paid for home, at the same value since you have said to ignore any appreciation). So, to determine what you have earned on the $40K you leveraged 5x, wouldn't it be a matter of computing a CAGR that gets you from $40K to $200K in 30 years? The result would be a nominal return, not a real return. So, if I set up the problem correctly, it should be: $40,000 * (1 + Return)^30 = $200,000 Then solve for Return. It works out to be about 5.51% or so.","instruction":"Based on your financial expertise, provide your response or viewpoint on the given financial question or topic. The response format is open."}

Actuaries look at how many times different makes and models get into accidents or are targeted by thieves, and how expensive it is to repair them. Many auto and finance sites will publish lists of the best and worst insurance risks. Family style cars like minivans and family sedans fair well, while sports cars get more expensive insurance. New models will get the risk of similar models until there is statistical data on them. One other take away from this discussion is that inexpensive insurance usually coincides with cheap repair costs, lowering your total cost of operation for your vehicle.","instruction":"Share your insights or perspective on the financial matter presented in the input."}

Second, you're assuming the cost of insurance would outweigh what the person would have to pay out of pocket if they didn't have insurance.  In other words as an example, if the insurance premiums on my car are so high that it would be cheaper for me to replace it myself in cash then it might make sense, but how likely is that to be the case?   There's a gambling adage that I think applies here - \"Always bet with the house's money\".  Why would I put my own money on the line in the event of some event rather than pay for an insurance policy that takes care of it for me?  That way, my costs are predictable and manageable - I pay the premiums and perhaps a deductible, and that's it.","instruction":"Offer your insights or judgment on the input financial query or topic using your financial expertise.

{"input":"Forex vs day trading for beginner investor","output":"Forex vs Day Trading: These can be one and the same, as most people who trade forex do it as day trading. Forex is the instrument you are trading and day trading is the time frame you are doing it in. If your meaning from your question was comparing trading forex vs stocks, then it depends on a number of things. Forex is more liquid so most professional traders prefer it as it can be easier to get in and out without being gapped. However, if you are not trading large amounts of money and you stay away from more volatile stocks, this should not matter too much. It may also depend on what you understand more and prefer to trade. You need to be comfortable with what you are trading. If on the other hand you are referring to day trading vs longer term trading and\/or investing, then this can depend largely on the instrument you are trading and the time frame you are more comfortable with. Forex is used more for shorter term trading, from day trading to having a position open for a couple of days. Stocks on the other hand can be day traded to traded over days, weeks, months or years. It is much more common to have positions open for longer periods with stocks. Other instruments like commodities, can also be traded over different time frames. The shorter the time frame you trade the higher risk involved as you have to make quick decisions and be happy with making a lot of smaller gains with the potential to make a large loss if things go wrong. It is best once again to chose a time frame you are comfortable with. I tend to trade Australian stocks as I know them well and am comfortable with them. I usually trade in the medium to long term, however I let the market decide how long I am in a position and when I get out of it. I try to follow the trend and stay in a position as long as the trend continues. I put automatic stop losses on all my positions, so if the market turns against me I am automatically taken out. I can be in a position for as little as a day (can happen if I buy one day and the next day the stock falls by 15% or more) to over a year (as long as the trend continues). By doing this I avoid the daily market noise and let my profits run and keep my losses small. No matter what instrument you end up trading and the time frame you choose to trade in, you should always have a tested trading plan and a risk management strategy in place. These are the areas you should first gain knowledge in to further your pursuits in trading.","instruction":"Based on your financial expertise, provide your response or viewpoint on the given financial question or topic.

I suggest forming the LLC in AZ\/CA and registering it as a foreign entity in the other state (AZ if formed in CA, the better option IMHO, or CA if formed in AZ).

{"input":"Using pivot points to trade in the short term","output":"What are Pivot Points? Pivot Points indicate price levels that are of significance in technical analysis of securities. Pivot Points are used to provide clarity for a trader as they are a predictive indicator of where a security might go. There are at least 6 different types of Pivot Points (Woodie Pivot Point, Fibonacci Pivot, Demark etc..) and they are different based on their formulas but generally serve the same concept. I will be answering your question using the Camarilla Pivot Point formula. Camarilla Pivot Point Formula Generally any Pivot Point formula uses a combination of the Open, High, Low and Close of the previous timeframe. Since you are technically a swing trader indicated by  say between a couple of days to a couple of weeks, as I don't want to   do day trading you should use a weekly 5 to 30 minute chart but you can also use a daily chart as well. So for example if you use a daily chart, you would use the Open, High, Low and Close of the previous day. Example of fictitious stock: MOSEX (Money Stack Exchange) 01\/14\/16: Open: 10.25, High: 12.55, Low: 9.65, Close: 11.50 On 01\/15\/16: R4 Level: 13.10, R3 Level: 12.30, R2 Level: 12.03, R1 Level: 11.77, Pivot Point: 11.23, S1 Level: 11.23, S2 Level: 10.97, S3 Level: 10.70, S4 Level: 9.91 R = Resistance, S = Support  How to identify these Pivot Points? Most charting software already have built in overlays that will identify the pivot points for you but you can always find and draw them yourself with an annotation tool. Since we are using the Camarilla Pivot Point formula, the important Pivot Point levels are the R4 which is considered as the Breakout Pivot, the S4 which is considered as the Breakdown Pivot. R3 and S3 are Reversal Pivot Points. Once identify the Pivot Points how should you proceed in a trade? This is the million dollar question and without spoon feeding you requires you to come up with your own strategy. To distinguish yourself from being a novice and pro trader is to have a strategy in a trade. Now I don't really have the time to look for actual charts to provide examples with but generally this is what you should look for to proceed in a trade: Potential Buy\/Short Signals: Potential Sell Signals: If a stock moves above the R3 Level but then crosses below it, this would be a sell signal. This is confirmed when their is a lower lower then the candle that first crosses below it. Sell a stock when S4 Level is confirmed. See above for the confirmation. Other Useful Tips: Use the Pivot Point as your support or resistance. The Pivot Point levels can be used for your stop loss. For example, with an S3 reversal buy signal, the S4 should be used as a stop loss. Conversely, the Pivot Point levels can also be used for your target prices. For example, with an S3 reversal buy signal, you should take some profits at R3 level. You should also use a combination of other indicators to give you more information to confirm if a signal is correct. Examples of a good combination is the RSI, MACD and Moving Averages.

These forms are going to ask for the total sales based on the tax category (tax free, x%, y%). Each transaction could have parts that fall into each category. The local taxing authority decides what goes into each category. The local taxing authority also determines how often the business needs to submit the taxes. They can even decide to base the rates used by where the customer lives.  A business is not required to charge directly for sales tax. That is why frequently at sporting events, the price on the menu notes that all sales taxes are included. I suppose not directly charging a sales tax makes the monthly calculation harder, but the state will still get their money.

{"input":"What is a Master Limited Partnership (MLP) & how is it different from plain stock?","output":"MLP stands for master limited partnership. Investors who buy into one are limited partners, rather than shareholders, and have their taxable income reported on K-1s, rather than 1099s. MLPs are engaged in businesses (e.g. real estate, natural resources) that generate a lot of cash that doesn't need to be \"reinvested,\" or put back into the company. Because of this feature, the IRS will exempt it from corporate tax if it pays out at least 95% of its income in the form of dividends. The advantage is that you avoid the \"double taxation\" common to most corporations, and get a higher yield as a result.  The disadvantage is that the company can't retain earnings for growth, and needs to borrow money if it wants to grow. In this regard, an MLP is much like a utility (except that a utility has to pay corporate taxes, and is otherwise heavily regulated by the Federal and\/or state governments). You can look upon an MLP as an unregulated utility. This means that MLPs are most suitable for utility type investors who are more interested in current income, than capital gains. Because they are unregulated, they are riskier than utilities.","instruction":"Utilize your financial knowledge, give your answer or opinion to the input question or subject .

{"input":"Should I buy a home or rent in my situation?","output":"First, you are not a loser nor an idiot! You have avoided many debt mistakes and have a stable income. This move will be good for you and your family and an opportunity to continue to build your life together. The fact you are even thinking about this and asking questions shows that you are responsible. To your rent\/buy question, Ben Miller has a great summary in his answer. I have nothing more to add except that you already know you cannot buy. That question is not really your main problem. You need some financial goals and then you need a plan to achieve those goals. As you become more educated about finances, it can be like drinking from a fire hose. Trying to analyze too much information can paralyze you and make you 'freak out' that you are messing everything up! Try this.  Think about where you want to be in 5 years or so. Write down with your fiance some of those dreams and goals. Maybe things like finish college degree(s), buy a house, pay off student loans, wedding, have more kids, etc... As you prioritize these things, you will see that some are short-term goals and some are long-term. Then you lay out a step by step plan to get there. By focusing on each step at a time, you see more success and are more motivated.  As you see movement towards your goals, you will be willing to sacrifice more to get there. You will be willing to rent a cheaper place with less room to make more headway on these things. This will be a several year plan, which is why it is so important to define your goals at the beginning. This will give you motivation and the mental toughness to follow through when it is difficult.","instruction":"Utilize your financial knowledge, give your answer or opinion to the input question or subject .

{"input":"23 and on my own, what should I be doing?","output":"Congratulations on earning a great income. However, you have a lot of debt and very high living expenses. This will eat all of your income if you don't get a hold of it now. I have a few recommendations for you.  At the beginning of each month, write down your income, and write down all your expenses for the month. Include everything: rent, food, utilities, entertainment, transportation, loan payments, etc.  After you've made this plan for the month, don't spend any money that's not in the plan. You are allowed to change the plan, but you can't spend more than your income. Budgeting software, such as YNAB, will make this easier.  You are $51,000 in debt. That is a lot. A large portion of your monthly budget is loan payments. I recommend that you knock those out as fast as possible. The interest on these loans makes the debt continue to grow the longer you hold them, which means that if you take your time paying these off, you'll be spending much more than $51k on your debt. Minimize that number and get rid of them as fast as possible. Because you want to get rid of the debt emergency as fast as possible, you should reduce your spending as much as you can and pay as much as you can toward the debt. Pay off that furniture first (the interest rate on that \"free money\" is going to skyrocket the first time you are late with a payment), then attack the student loans. Stay home and cook your own meals as much as possible. You may want to consider moving someplace cheaper.  The rent you are paying is not out of line with your income, but New York is a very expensive place to live in general.  Moving might help you reduce your expenses. I hope you realize at this point that it was pretty silly of you to borrow $4k for a new bedroom set while you were $47k in debt. You referred to your low-interest loans as \"free money,\" but they really aren't. They all need to be paid back. Ask yourself: If you had forced yourself to save up $4k before buying the furniture, would you still have purchased the furniture, or would you have instead bought a used set on Craigslist for $200? This is the reason that furniture stores offer 0% interest loans. They got you to buy something that you couldn't afford. Don't take the bait again.  You didn't mention credit cards, so I hope that means that you don't owe any money on credit cards. If you do, then you need to start thinking of that as debt, and add that to your debt emergency. If you do use a credit card, commit to only charging what you already have in the bank and paying off the card in full every month. YNAB can make this easier.  $50\/hr and $90k per year are fairly close to each other when you factor in vacation and holidays. That is not including other benefits, so any other benefits put the salaried position ahead. You said that you have a few more years on your parents' health coverage, but there is no need to wait until the last minute to get your own coverage. Health insurance is a huge benefit. Also, in general, I would say that salaried positions have better job security. (This is no guarantee, of course. Anyone can get laid off. But, as a contractor, they could tell you not to come in tomorrow, and you'd be done. Salaried employees are usually given notice, severance pay, etc.) if I were you, I would take the salaried position.  Investing is important, but so is eliminating this debt emergency. If you take the salaried position, one of your new benefits will be a retirement program. You can take advantage of that, especially if the company is kicking in some money. (This actually is \"free money.\") But in my opinion, if you treat the debt as an emergency and commit to eliminating it as fast as possible, you should minimize your investing at this point, if it helps you get out of debt faster. After you get out of debt, investing should be one of your major goals.  Now, while you are young and have few commitments, is the best time to learn to live on a budget and eliminate your debt. This will set you up for success in the future.","instruction":"Utilize your financial knowledge, give your answer or opinion to the input question or subject . Answer format is not limited."}

{"input":"How are mortgage interest rates determined?","output":"Mortgage or other interest rates are determined by the banks on cost of funds, risk and operating cost.   The Fed raises money from the markets by issuing Tresury Bonds at a specified rate. This rate at which it raises money varies depening on the economy. Thus there are 2 rates: the rate at which banks can borrow money from the Fed, which is higher than the rate that the Fed would give banks for excess money deposited with them. So if the cost of borrowing is less, banks can borrow this money from the Fed and loan it to individuals at a slightly higher rate that would cover their costs plus a small profit. The risk associated with a mortgage is less, and hence these would be cheaper, then say a personal loan.  If the cost of borrowing goes up, the mortgage rate will go up. If the cost of borrowing money goes down, the cost would come down. Banks may not always borrow money to lend. If they have existing money, they can either park it with the Fed for a lower interest rate, or loan it to individuals for a rate higher than what they would have received from the Fed.","instruction":"Based on your financial expertise, provide your response or viewpoint on the given financial question or topic.

The restriction for needing to be a \"qualified institutional buyer\" (QIB) arises from the parent company not having registered the spin-off company rights [options] or shares (yet?) for sale in the United States. Shares sold in the U.S. must either be registered with the SEC or qualify for some exemption. See SEC Fast Answers - Securities Act Rule 144. Quoting: Selling restricted or control securities in the marketplace can be a   complicated process. This is because the sales are so close to the   interests of the issuing company that the law might require them to be   registered. Under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, all offers   and sales of securities must be registered with the SEC or qualify for   some exemption from the registration requirements.

{"input":"What happens if futures contract seller defaults?","output":"MD-Tech answered: The answer is in your question: derivatives are contracts so are enforced in the same way as any other contract.  If the counterparty refuses to pay immediately they will, in the first instance be billed by any intermediary (Prime Broker etc.) that facilitated the contract. If they still refuse to pay the contract may stipulate that a broker can \"net off\" any outstanding payments against it or pay out using deposited cash or posted margins. The contract will usually include the broker as an interested party and so they can, but don't need to, report a default (such that this is) to credit agencies (in some jurisdictions they are required to by law). Any parties to the trade and the courts may use a debt collection agency to collect payments or seize assets to cover payment. If there is no broker or the counterparty still has not paid the bill then the parties involved (the party to the trade and any intermediaries) can sue for breach of contract. If they win (which would be expected) the counterparty will be made to pay by the legal system including, but not limited to, seizure of assets, enforced bankruptcy, and prison terms for any contempts of court rulings. All of this holds for governments who refuse to pay derivatives losses (as Argentina did in the early 20th century) but in that case it may escalate as far as war. It has never done so for derivatives contracts as far as I know but other breaches of contract between countries have resulted in armed conflict. As well as the \"hard\" results of failing to pay there are soft implications including a guaranteed fall in credit ratings that will result in parties refusing to do business with the counterparty and a separate loss of reputation that will reduce business even further. Potential employees and funders will be unwilling to become involved with such a party and suppliers will be unwilling to supply on credit. The end result in almost every way would be bankruptcy and prison sentences for the party or their senior employees. Most jurisdictions allow for board members at companies in material breach of contract to be banned from running any company for a set period as well. edit: netting off cash flows netting off is a process whereby all of a party's cash flows, positive and negative, are used to pay each other off so that only the net change is reflected in account balances, for example: company 1 cash flows netting off the total outgoings are 3M + 500k = 3.5M and total incomings are 1.2M + 1.1M + 1.2M = 3.5M so the incoming cash flows can be used to pay the outgoing cash flows leaving a net payment into company1's account of 0.","instruction":"Utilize your financial knowledge, give your answer or opinion to the input question or subject .

{"input":"Money Structuring","output":"Structuring, as noted in another answer, involves breaking up cash transactions to avoid the required reporting limits.   There are a couple of important things to note.   And, the biggest caveat - there have been many cases of perfectly legitimate transactions that have fallen foul of the reporting requirements.  One case springs to mind of a small business that routinely deposited the previous day's receipts as cash, and due to the size of the business, those deposits typically fell in the $9,000-$9,500 range.  This business ended up going through a lot of headaches and barely survived.  Some don't.

Those who have little financial experience are often in the greatest need of a financial adviser and at the same time are the least qualified to select one. I'm not putting you or anyone in particular in this category. And of course it's a sliding scale: In general the more capable you are of running your own finances the more prepared you are to answer this question. With that said, I would recommend backing up half a step. Consider advisers other than strictly fee-only advisers. Perhaps you have already considered this decision. But perhaps others reading this have not. My (Ameriprise) adviser charges a monthly (~$50) fee, but also gets percentage-based portions of certain investments. Based on a $150\/hr rate that amounts to four hours per year. Does he spend four hours per year on my account? Well so far he does (~2 yrs). But that is determined primarily by how much interaction I choose to have with him. (I suppose I could spend more time asking him questions and less time on this forum. :P) I have never fully understood the gravitation towards fee-based advisers on principle. I guess the theory is they are not making biased decisions about your investments because they don't have as much of a stake in how well your investments to do. I don't necessarily see that as an advantage. It seems they would have less of an incentive to ensure the growth of your investments. Although if you're nearing retirement then growth isn't your biggest concern. Perhaps a fee-based adviser makes more sense in that scenario. Whatever pay structure your adviser uses, it would seem to make sense to consider a successful adviser with a good client base. This implies that the adviser knows what he\/she is doing. (But it could also just be a sign that they are good at marketing themselves.) If your adviser has a good base of wealthy clients then choosing a strictly-fee based adviser would mitigate the risk of your adviser having less incentive to consider your portfolio vs that of more wealthy clients. To more directly answer your question I suggest asking several of your adviser candidates for advice on choosing an adviser.

{"input":"In Canada, can a limited corporation be used as an income tax shelter?","output":"(Disclaimer: I am not an accountant nor a tax pro, etc., etc.) Yes, a Canadian corporation can function as a partial income tax shelter.  This is possible since a corporation can retain earnings (profits) indefinitely, and corporate income tax rates are generally less than personal income tax rates.  Details: If you own and run your business through a corporation, you can choose to take income from your corporation in one of two ways:  as salary, or as dividends. Salary constitutes an expense of the corporation, i.e. it gets deducted from revenue in calculating corporate taxable income.  No corporate income tax is due on money paid out as salary.  However, personal income taxes and other deductions (e.g. CPP) would apply to salary at regular rates, the same as for a regular employee. Dividends are paid by the corporation to shareholders out of after-tax profits.  i.e. the corporation first pays income tax on taxable income for the fiscal year, and resulting net income could be used to pay dividends (or not). At the personal level, dividends are taxed less than salary to account for tax the corporation paid.  The net effect of corporate + personal tax is about the same as for salary (leaving out deductions like CPP.) The key point: Dividends don't have to be paid out in the year the money was earned.  The corporation can carry profits forward (retained earnings) as long as it wants and choose to issue dividends (or not) in later years. Given that, here's how would the partial income tax shelter works: At some point, for you to personally realize income from the corporation, you can have the corporation declare a dividend. You'll then have to pay personal income taxes on the income, at the dividend rates.  But for as long as the money was invested inside the corporation, it was subject only to lesser corporate tax rates, not higher personal income tax rates.  Hence the \"partial\" aspect of this kind of tax shelter. Or, if you're lucky enough to find a buyer for your corporation, you could qualify for the Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption on proceeds up to $750,000 when you sell a qualified small business corporation.  This is the best exit strategy; unfortunately, not an easy one where the business has no valuable assets (e.g. a client base, or intellectual property.) * The major sticking-point:  You need to have real business revenue!

The people at the deli then exchange those tokens for other favors, and that's the entire economy: people doing favors for other people in exchange for tokens that represent more favors. Sometimes being invested in your spouse is giving them a back rub when they've had a hard day. The investment pays off when you have a hard day and they give you a back rub. Sometimes being invested in your spouse is taking them to a masseuse for a professional massage. The investment pays off when they get two tickets to that thing you love. At the small scale it's easy to mostly ignore minor monetary discrepancies. At the large scale (which I think \u00a350k is plenty large enough given your listed net worth) it becomes harder to tell if the opportunity cost will be worth making that investment. It pretty much comes down to: Will the quality-of-life improvements from that investment be better than the quality-of-life improvements you receive from investing that money elsewhere? As far as answering your actual question of: How should I proceed? There isn't a one-size fits all answer to this. It comes down to decisions you have to make, such as: * in theory it's easy to say that everyone should be able to trust their spouse, but in practice there are a lot of people who are very bad at handling money. It can be worthwhile in some instances to keep your spouse at an arms length from your finances for their own good, such as if your spouse has a gambling addiction. With all of that said, it sounds like you're living in a \u00a31.5m house rent-free. How much of an opportunity cost is that to your wife? Has she been freely investing in your well-being with no explicit expectation of being repaid? This can be your chance to provide a return on her investment. If it were me, I'd make the investment in my spouse, and consider it \"rent\" while enjoying the improvements to my quality of life that come with it.","instruction":"Offer your insights or judgment on the input financial query or topic using your financial expertise.

{"input":"Why call option price increases with higher volatility","output":"When volatility is higher, the option is more likely to end up in-the-money. Moreover, when it ends up in-the-money, it is likely to be over the strike price by a greater amount. Consider a call option. With high volatility, moves in the stock price are big - both up moves and down moves. If the stock moves up by a lot, the call option holder will benefit greatly. On the other hand, when the stock moves down, below a certain point the option holder does not care how big a down move the stock has. His downside is limited. Hence, the value of the option is increased by high volatility. I know everyone who searches this is looking for this answer.

{"input":"Why is the regulation of \u201cswaps\u201d important to failing systemically significant institutions?","output":"Have you ever considered how much faith and confidence play a role in the financial sector?  The calling in of swaps could cause issues similar to a Bank Run, which may or may not involve others coming into play.  While this is cleaning up the mess from a few years ago, there is something to be said for how complicated are various financial instruments in this situation. If you want something similar to ponder, what would make any institution be considered major and would this be agreed by various countries given how connected things are within the world?  What makes an institution major in the United States may not be quite the same standards in Brazil and this where one has to consider how to maintain faith in the system that could unravel rather badly if everyone tries to cash out at the same time.  The Bank Run link above is something to consider that could cause a bank that appears fine to suddenly have speculators cause more disruptions which isn't likely to help.  The global credit markets aren't likely to freeze overnight and thus there can be the question how does this get handled if another mess could arise. The idea here is to set up the framework to prevent the panic that could lead to a global depression.  The idea is to create for derivatives something similar to the stock market's trading curbs that exist to contain panic on a macro level.  The psychology is quite important in figuring out how to handle the obligations of a company that was perceived to be infallible as well as making sure what is agreed works across various cultures and currencies.","instruction":"Share your insights or perspective on the financial matter presented in the input."}

As for the comment that this is the type of investing that caused the 1929 stock market crash, there are many other aspects that are overlooked.

{"input":"Refinance when going to sell?","output":"When evaluating a refinance, it all comes down to the payback. Refinancing costs money in closing costs. There are different reasons for refinancing, and they all have different methods for calculating payback.  One reason to finance is to get a lower interest rate. When determining the payback time, you calculate how long it would take to recover your closing costs with the amount you save in interest. For example, if the closing costs are $2,000, your payback time is 2 years if it takes 2 years to save that amount in interest with the new interest rate vs. the old one. The longer you hold the mortgage after you refinance, the more money you save in interest with the new rate. Generally, it doesn't pay to refinance to a lower rate right before you sell, because you aren't holding the mortgage long enough to see the interest savings. You seem to be 3 years away from selling, so you might be able to see some savings here in the next three years.  A second reason people refinance is to lower their monthly payment if they are having trouble paying it. I see you are considering switching from a 15 year to a 30 year; is one of your goals to reduce your monthly payment? By refinancing to a 30 year, you'll be paying a lot of interest in your first few years of payments, extending the payback time of your lower interest rate.  A third reason people refinance is to pull cash out of their equity. This applies to you as well. Since you are planning on using it to remodel the home you are trying to sell, you have to ask yourself if the renovations you are planning will payoff in the increased sale price of your home. Often, renovations don't increase the value of their home as much as they cost. You do renovations because you will enjoy living in the renovated home, and you get some of your money back when you sell. But sometimes you can increase the value of your home by enough to cover the cost of the renovation. Talk to a real estate agent in your area to get their advice on how much the renovations you are talking about will increase the value of your home.","instruction":"Offer your insights or judgment on the input financial query or topic using your financial expertise.

{"input":"valuing options","output":"Below I will try to explain two most common Binomial Option Pricing Models (BOPM) used. First of all, BOPM splits time to expiry into N equal sub-periods and assumes that in each period the underlying security price may rise or fall by a known proportion, so the value of an option in any sub-period is a function of its possible values in the following sub period. Therefore the current value of an option is found by working backwards from expiry date through sub-periods to current time. There is not enough information in the question from your textbook so we may assume that what you are asked to do is to find a value of a call option using just a Single Period BOPM. Here are two ways of doing this: First of all let's summarize your information: Current Share Price (Vs) = $70 Strike or exercise price (X) = $60 Risk-free rate (r) = 5.5% or 0.055 Time to maturity (t) = 12 months Downward movement in share price for the period (d) = $65 \/ $70 = 0.928571429 Upward movement in share price for the period (u) = 1\/d = 1\/0.928571429 = 1.076923077 \"u\" can be translated to $ multiplying by Vs => 1.076923077 * $70 = $75.38 which is the maximum probable share price in 12 months time. If you need more clarification here - the minimum and maximum future share prices are calculated from stocks past volatility which is a measure of risk. But because your textbook question does not seem to be asking this - you probably don't have to bother too much about it yet. Intrinsic Value: Just in case someone reading this is unclear - the Value of an option on maturity is the difference between the exercise (strike) price and the value of a share at the time of the option maturity. This is also called an intrinsic value.  Note that American Option can be exercised prior to it's maturity in this case the intrinsic value it simply the diference between strike price and the underlying share price at the time of an exercise. But the Value of an option at period 0 (also called option price) is a price you would normally pay in order to buy it. So, say, with a strike of $60 and Share Price of $70 the intrinsic value is $10, whereas if Share Price was $50 the intrinsic value would be $0. The option price or the value of a call option in both cases would be fixed.  So we also need to find intrinsic option values when price falls to the lowest probable and rises to the maximum probable (Vcd and Vcu respectively) (Vcd) = $65-$60 = $5 (remember if Strike was $70 then Vcd would be $0 because nobody would exercise an option that is out of the money) (Vcu) = $75.38-$60 = $15.38 1. Setting up a hedge ratio:  h = Vs*(u-d)\/(Vcu-Vcd) h = 70*(1.076923077-0.928571429)\/(15.38-5) = 1 That means we have to write (sell) 1 option for each share purchased in order to hedge the risks. You can make a simple calculation to check this, but I'm not going to go into too much detail here as the equestion is not about hedging. Because this position is risk-free in equilibrium it should pay a risk-free rate (5.5%). Then, the formula to price an option (Vc) using the hedging approach is: (Vs-hVc)(e^(rt))=(Vsu-hVcu) Where (Vc) is the value of the call option, (h) is the hedge ratio, (Vs) - Current Share Price, (Vsu) - highest probable share price, (r) - risk-free rate, (t) - time in years, (Vcu) - value of a call option on maturity at the highest probable share price. Therefore solving for (Vc): (70-1*Vc)(e^(0.055*(12\/12))) = (75.38-1*15.38) => (70-Vc)*1.056540615 = 60 => 70-Vc = 60\/1.056540615 => Vc = 70 - (60\/1.056540615)  Which is similar to the formula given in your textbook, so I must assume that using 1+r would be simply a very close approximation of the formula above. Then it is easy to find that Vc = 13.2108911402 ~ $13.21 2. Risk-neutral valuation: Another way to calculate (Vc) is using a risk-neutral approach. We first introduce a variable (p) which is a risk-neutral probability of an increase in share price. p = (e^(r*t)-d)\/(u-d) so in your case: p = (1.056540615-0.928571429)\/(1.076923077-0.928571429) = 0.862607107 Therefore using (p) the (Vc) would be equal: Vc = [pVcu+(1-p)Vcd]\/(e^(rt)) => Vc = [(0.862607107*15.38)+(0.137392893*5)]\/1.056540615 => Vc = 13.2071229185 ~ $13.21 As you can see it is very close to the hedging approach. I hope this answers your questions. Also bear in mind that there is much more to the option pricing than this.

Analysts are predicting a run to Dow 40,000 with UnitedHealth highlighted as one of the stocks that will drive the bulk of this surge. This suggests growing investor confidence and potential increased investment in UnitedHealth.\n2. Despite experiencing a cyberattack affecting their Change Health division, UnitedHealth was able to enable a new instance of its service for all customers. This demonstrates resilience and responsiveness to unexpected contingencies.\n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. UnitedHealth experienced a cyberattack by the Russian-based BlackCat ransomware group that affected its Change Healthcare division. This highlights the company's susceptibility to technological vulnerabilities.\n2. The cyberattack had 'far-reaching' effects on providers impacting billing, eligibility checks, prior authorization requests and prescription fulfillment. This has likely impacted UnitedHealth's reputation and may have led to disruption in business operations, potentially affecting their earnings in the short term.\n3. The company's Debt to Equity ratio is relatively high at 0.7046. A high debt-to-equity ratio generally means that a company has been aggressive in financing its growth with debt, which can result in volatile earnings.\n  \n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Down by 2-3%\nAnalysis: Given the recent cyberattack news and its ongoing implications, there may be a short-term negative impact on UnitedHealth Group's stock price. Investors might adopt a cautious approach in the wake of cybersecurity concerns and disruption to business operations. Furthermore, the high Debt to Equity ratio could contribute to investor's apprehension due to the potential for volatile earnings. Therefore, I predict that UnitedHealth Group's stock price may trend down by 2-3% in the upcoming week. However, the company has shown resilience in their recovery efforts and it could bounce back once the cyberattack issues clear out. The company's inclusion as a key player in the predicted Dow 40,000 run also implies that in the longer term, the stock may show recovery and growth.","instruction":"Forecast for UNH in 2024-03-03 to 2024-03-10"}

The introduction of AI by CEO Jamie Dimon signifies a strategic move towards increasing efficiency in operations which may lead to enhanced earnings in the future.\n3. The company's rich reward program for Chase Freedom cardmembers indicates a strong customer retention strategy which can enhance overall company performance.\n4. Financial analysis shows positive ratios such as ROE, ROA, and ROIC which signals a strong operational, financial, and investment performance.\n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. JPMorgan, along with some other major banks, has withdrawn from the Equator Principles, a potentially negative image risk from a sustainability and social responsibility perspective.\n2. JPMorgan settling to pay $348M Fine for alleged failures in monitoring its trading activities raises concern over its risk management systems and regulatory compliance.\n3. The company's long-term debt to total asset ratio is more than 9%, which may indicate relatively high levels of borrowed capital, potentially increasing financial risk.\n4. JPMorgan has a significant total debt to equity ratio of 1.866, which might worry some investors, due to the elevated risk levels associated with high debt.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Up by 3-4%\nAnalysis: Despite the potential concerns, the positive developments seem to outweigh the negatives for JPMorgan. The consistent price rise of their shares suggests investor confidence in the company. The implementation of AI represents a strategic move to keep up with trending digital transformations in the banking sector which can provide a significant edge. The competitive reward program for Chase Freedom\u00ae cardholders represents a good customer retention strategy. The company's strong financial ratios indicate solid performance and efficiency.\n\nOn the flip side, although JPMorgan's withdrawal from the Equator Principles and the imposed fine raise some alarm for risk management and corporate responsibility, these incidents do not directly impact the current operational and financial performance of the company.\n\nLooking at JPMorgan's basic financials, it possesses a promising book value and its other ratios signify healthy company management and return generation. The debt ratios, while higher than ideal, reflect the nature of the banking sector where leveraging is often a key part of business operations. It is important, however, to monitor these levels to ensure they don't become overly risky.\n\nBased on these factors, the company's stock is predicted to continue its upward trend with a 3-4% rise for the upcoming week. This is due to the perceived strength and stability of the company, reinforced by positive market sentiment and promising financial ratios. As such, the stock remains a desirable investment, offering potentially strong returns. However, investors should continue to monitor the company's sustainability commitment and risk management strategy, to maintain a comprehensive understanding of the investment's health.","instruction":"Forecast for JPM in 2024-03-17 to 2024-03-24"}

The company is taking steps to comply with EU mandates, thereby negating potential regulatory challenges in the European market.\n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. Apple's primary revenue generator, the iPhone, has seen a 10% fall in shipments, signaling potential worry for revenues.\n2. The company faced a downgrade recently that resulted in a slide in stock market performance.\n3. Apple is facing stiff competition from other companies like PayPal, Google Pay, and Android companies, a challenge which could affect market share and eventually, stock performance.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Down by more than 5%\nAnalysis: Given the concerns listed above, in the short-term there's a potential risk that the stock price could briefly continue the downward trend. The drop in iPhone sales is particularly concerning as it is Apple's main source of income. Furthermore, increased competition particularly in the payment service could lower revenues. These factors, plus the dampening effect of the recent downgrade, could lead to negative sentiments among investors, potentially aggravating the drop in stock prices for the next week. This, coupled with the company's current high Price to Earnings ratio of 29.67, may suggest it's somewhat overvalued, providing another reason for a potential price correction in the near term. \n\nHowever, in the long term, Apple is still a valuable company with high potential due to its strong brand, capacity for innovation and solid financial fundamentals.","instruction":"Forecast for AAPL in 2024-04-14 to 2024-04-21"}

While potential economic downshifts and relatively high debt ratios may pose threats in the long term, these don't immediately signal a drop in stock price for the upcoming week.\n\nA boost in investor confidence as seen in recent news does suggest increased buying activity that would likely contribute to a temporary rise in stock price. The fact that various financial analysts are bullish, coupled with the perception of being undervalelyed, may work as fertile ground for a short-term growth spurt, even in the face of uncertainties.\n\nTherefore, it is predicted that Caterpillar Inc's stock price may indeed see a rise of about 3-4% in the next week, based on cumulative positive developments and improved investor sentiment. Although concerns should be properly considered for long-term investments, they're unlikely to have an immediate effect on the stock price for the following week.","instruction":"Forecast for CAT in 2024-03-17 to 2024-03-24"}

Intel has been named in an analyst report as one of the top stocks to invest in, which indicates its financial stability and potential for sustained growth.\n2. The company is also actively investing in the rapidly growing Artificial Intelligence (AI) sector, which has future growth potential, as reflected in the news about its rivals.\n3. Intel's upcoming investor webinar on new segment reporting indicates that the company is communicating actively with its investors, demonstrating its confidence and business transparency.\n \n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. Despite the overall market performance being in favor, Intel\u2019s share price underperformed when compared to its competitors mentioned in news.\n2. Competition from Nvidia, as it\u2019s mentioned comparing the investments in startups and AI abilities of Intel and Nvidia. The robust growth of Nvidia in AI business could pose a threat to Intel's market share.\n3. Its high PE ratio of 125.4316 suggests the stock may be overpriced compared to its earnings.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Down by 3-4%\nAnalysis: Although Intel continues to expand and explore growth opportunities in AI, the growing competition from rivals is a cause for concern. The underperformance of its shares compared to competitors, despite positive overall market conditions, reveals a weaker than average investor sentiment.\n\nAn additional red flag is the high PE ratio, indicating that the stock might currently be overvalued. High PE ratios are frequently criticized as signs that the security could be overpriced or that investors might be expecting high growth rates in the future that the company may not be able to meet.\n\nThus, based on these factors, the prediction is a downward trend for Intel's stock price in the next week (2024-03-10 to 2024-03-17), with a potential decrease of around 3-4%. This prediction assumes no major announcements or market disruptions will occur in the coming week. Investors should consider these factors in conjunction with their financial situations and risk tolerance before making investment decisions.","instruction":"Forecast for INTC in 2024-03-10 to 2024-03-17"}

Boeing's Free Cash Flow per Share TTM at 7.27 signifies robust cash-generating power of the company and its strong liquidity position, which underpins its capacity to endure tough times and outrun challenges.\n\nConsidering the recent sharp sell-off, the company's sturdy financials, and the potential for improved sentiment with new sale opportunities, we can anticipate a rebound in Boeing's share price next week. My prediction would be an increase in the stock price by around 3-4%.

Despite the strong financial performance, with e.g. an impressive net margin of 0.1808 and return on equity (ROE) of 0.5931, the broader market volatility and potential leadership shakeup could cause some investors to be cautious. The positive is that the company is financially stable and has maintained its dividend payout, indicating its robustness amidst challenging market conditions. However, its price-to-earnings ratio (P\/E) of 16.149 suggests that it may be comparatively overvalued, which could contribute to a downward adjustment in the short term. \n\nIn conclusion, while the long-term outlook for Caterpillar remains promising, these uncertainties combined with current valuation levels may lead to a temporary downward shift in the stock price in the coming week, estimated at approximately 3-4%. This, however, could pose as a potential buying opportunity given the strong fundamentals of the company.","instruction":"Forecast for CAT in 2024-04-21 to 2024-04-28"}

Johnson & Johnson received FDA approval for its pulmonary arterial hypertension pill, and another treatment for a rare, pregnancy-related disease which also received a fast-track designation from the FDA. This likely implies increased revenue in the future.\n2. A U.S judge ruled that Johnson & Johnson can contest the scientific evidence linking its talc to cancer. This could potentially disrupt more than 53,000 lawsuits that the company is currently facing.\n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. Johnson & Johnson's subsidiary, Abiomed's latest Impella recall linked to 129 injury and 49 death reports. The report about the risk of the catheter perforating the heart could shake customer and investor confidence, reflecting negatively on the stock. \n2. The report indicates that Johnson & Johnson's shares have seen a 1.7% decrease in the past month, suggesting investor caution.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Down by 3-4%\nAnalysis: Despite some positive developments, such as FDA approvals and potential relief in lawsuit burden, there are concerning factors that cannot be overlooked. The negative news surrounding Abiomed\u2019s recall might significantly damage the brand's reputation and trustworthiness, thereby possibly impacting the stock price. Also, considering the recent decline in shares, investors seem to be treading carefully around JNJ. \n\nMoreover, while getting an opportunity to contest evidence in talc lawsuits is good news, it indicates a continued legal battle that could lead to financial and reputational costs for the company in the short term. Additionally, JNJ's PE ratio is lower than the industry average, indicating the market may not have much confidence in its earnings growth, despite decent financial performances.\n\nGiven these factors, there could be a downward pressure on the stock price in the upcoming week. Therefore, a prediction of a 3-4% decrease in stock price seems plausible.","instruction":"Forecast for JNJ in 2024-03-31 to 2024-04-07"}

Leading energy companies are looking into renewable energy using fracking technology, a venture which Chevron can lend its expertise to and profit from since it's one of the well-established oil companies.\n2. There is significant investor interest in American stocks since growth metrics have been strong recently. This will likely draw attention to Chevron's stock.\n3. Oil companies in the U.S. had their highest oil production than any other country last year, signaling a valuable boom period for Chevron.\n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. There are ongoing negotiations with Exxon and China\u2019s Cnooc Ltd. over a major oil drilling project in Guyana. However, these ended abruptly which may cause uncertainty among investors.\n2. Hess may have to pay Chevron a breakup fee of $1.7 billion if the deal collapses, this could affect Chevron's financial standing.\n3. There has been some fluctuation in Chevron's stock prices within the last three weeks, signaling a potentially volatile period in the stock market for the company.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Up by 1-2%\nAnalysis: Looking ahead to the week from 2024-03-24 to 2024-03-31, I predict that Chevron's stock price will rise by approximately 1-2%. This prediction stems from the company's robust performance in the previous financial year, coupled with the increasing interest in American stocks and the ongoing boom period for oil companies in the U.S. \n\nDespite some fluctuation in the stock prices, the potential for Chevron's involvement in renewable energy harnessing projects through its deep well expertise, and the potential for more mergers and acquisitions, all point to increased investor confidence. While there are concerns about Chevron's break-up fee and halted negotiations over the Guyana project, I believe the positive aspects outweigh the potential risks. \n\nIn the long term, these factors, paired with the underlying strength of Chevron's financials, the attractive dividend yield, and continued investor interest in the energy sector all indicate an upward trajectory for the stock price. However, investors must closely monitor the on-going negotiations and their impact on Chevron's position in the market in the future.","instruction":"Forecast for CVX in 2024-03-24 to 2024-03-31"}

The company faces stiff competition from its rival, Adidas, and its product innovation struggles could hurt its ability to retain market share. Furthermore, the layoffs suggest internal or financial difficulties that could impact the company's performance.\n\nThe recent criticism over the design of the women's Olympic uniform might also dent the company's brand reputation and subsequently harm its stock price. Although the signing of a new deal with Caitlin Clark is positive, it's unlikely to offset the impact of these issues within the next week.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it is predicted that Nike Inc's stock price may experience a 1-2% decrease in the following week. However, it's important to note that stock prices are influenced by a variety of complex factors, and this prediction is made based on the available data and recent developments.","instruction":"Forecast for NKE in 2024-04-28 to 2024-05-05"}

Meanwhile, although IBM's focus on advanced connectivity and digitalization in Europe and the heightened interest in AI could favor its business trajectory, it might not be enough to offset the potential risks in the short term, especially within the span of the upcoming week. \n\nFurthermore, the significant payout ratio suggests that IBM is using a considerable portion of its earnings to pay dividends.

The tech giant is just one of three \"Magnificent 7\" stocks that are underperforming this year. However, KeyBanc has initiated coverage on Microsoft (MSFT) as Overweight, setting a price target of $490. Keybanc Managing Director of Software Equity Research Jackson Ader joins the Live show to discuss his call. What sets Microsoft apart from other tech names is its AI monetization abilities, Adler highlights. The analyst explains that Microsoft is monetizing via Keybanc's preferred pathways: metering workload to the cloud and direct monetization from co-pilot. \"They are actually putting revenue on the board, whereas a lot of other software companies right now, it's speculation,\" Adler states. In Keybanc surveys, Adler continues, CIOs claim Microsoft has AI capabilities that are \"superior\" over other vendors: \"Customers are saying this is where we want to go for AI,\" Adler concludes.

Cisco recently obtained unconditional EU antitrust approval for its $28 billion acquisition of cybersecurity firm Splunk, highlighting its continued efforts to expand its software business and implement AI advancements. \n2. Upon completion, the acquisition of Splunk, ahead of schedule, was deemed cash-flow positive and estimated to enhance Cisco's non-GAAP gross margin in the next fiscal year. \n3. The company is actively utilizing generative AI to address managerial issues and drive collaborative efficiency within the enterprise.\n4. Cisco and Telenor have enhanced their collaboration to advance shared strategic initiatives that include sustainability, connectivity, security, and managed services, indicating an interest in optimizing their operations and accelerating growth. \n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. A noted lack of technology advantages in high-growth markets along with weak order growth might indicate potential subdued revenue growth for the company in the future.\n2. Adjustments to the integration of Splunk and its observability software into Cisco's operations may cause short term operational disruptions.\n3. Questions about Nvidia's fate post-AI boom might cast doubts over Cisco's decision to bet heavily in AI technologies and invigorate concerns about a potential bubble in the sector.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Up by 0-1%\nAnalysis: Considering the latest set of positive developments, particularly the successful completion of the Splunk acquisition, Cisco's presence in the AI-driven cybersecurity sphere looks set to expand significantly. This key acquisition, sanctioned by EU regulators, is likely to offer a considerable boost to Cisco's existing software business and diversify its product portfolio.\n\nOn the other hand, caution is needed due to existing concerns about seemingly weak technological advantages in high-growth markets, which could lead to slower revenue growth. The effective integration of AI may also face unexpected roadblocks, as transforming workspaces with new technologies is proven to be challenging and expensive. \n\nHowever, the underlying strength of Cisco's fundamentals, highlighted by reasonable valuations (P\/E of 15.8) and a positive FCF margin (4.99%), suggests that the positive factors slightly outweigh the concerns. Therefore, a modest uptick in stock price can be expected for the next week, with an assumption of approximately 0-1% growth. It will be imperative to monitor progress in technology integration and any further strategic decisions in the coming weeks to reassess the forecast. Ultimately, while potential concerns exist, Cisco's recent strategic moves and robust financial condition indicate promising potential for future growth.","instruction":"Forecast for CSCO in 2024-03-24 to 2024-03-31"}

Dow Inc. appears to be 42% undervalued based on intrinsic value calculations derived from their free cash flow to equity, which suggests there's room for substantial price appreciation.\n2. The company has announced its plans to host an investor day on May 16, 2024. This event provides an opportunity for the management team to share their strategic planning and financial priorities, which could boost investor sentiment.\n3. Dow Inc. continues to engage in sustainability efforts through their focus on managing scarce freshwater resources, which are key to healthy ecosystems. Such initiatives enhance the company's brand image and appeal to the increasing pool of ESG-focused investors.\n4. The company's focus on unlocking the value of waste and innovating in the materials ecosystem positions it as a sustainability leader, which is likely to be received favorably by market participants.\n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. The company's stock underperformed compared to its competitors on a particular trading day, which could cause concerns about its relative strength in the market.\n2. Despite overall profitability, the company reported negative EPS (-0.1492) at year-end 2023 indicating they are not generating adequate profits for shareholders.\n3. Dow Inc. has a higher long-term debt to equity ratio (0.7605) and total debt to equity ratio (0.8108), suggesting a higher risk profile which could potentially impact stock performance.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Up by 0-1%\nAnalysis: Despite the potential concerns, Dow Inc.'s positive developments outweigh the negatives. Primarily, the projected intrinsic value calculation shows a potential undervaluation of its stock, providing a strong catalyst for appreciation. The upcoming investor day is likely to serve as an additional positive driver if management delivers a convincing strategy and financial plan.\n\nMoreover, Dow Inc.'s ESG efforts around water management and waste reduction are impressive, attracting an increased interest from sustainability-focused investors. This trend along with the market's growing tilt towards ESG investing might serve as a tailwind for DOW's stock.\n\nBased on these factors, and given the fact that the company seems fundamentally undervalued, I predict that Dow Inc.'s stock will see a mild increase of up to 1% in the coming week as investors start to price in these positive developments.","instruction":"Forecast for DOW in 2024-02-25 to 2024-03-03"}

Thus, I would predict a slight downward movement of the UNH stock price by 0-1% in the upcoming week. It's advisable to watch how the company manages the long term impact of the cyber attack, and how it handles its debt position.

The CEO's optimistic outlook, the selection of HSBC and Standard Chartered for their Hong Kong and Taiwan businesses, and the stock's strong performance all suggest a continuation of the upward trend.\n\nConsidering these developments, the prediction is that JPMorgan's stock price will go up by 1-2% for the upcoming week (2024-03-03 to 2024-03-10).

Nike's (NKE) slogan and 'Swoosh' logo that defines the iconic brand is now a staple for footwear, athletic apparel, and pop culture. The company generated more than $51 billion in revenue in 2023, an increase of about $4.5 billion year-over-year. Let's take a closer look at Nike's biggest moments with Beyond the Ticker, which charts its path to becoming a global icon. 1964 Nike was originally founded as Blue Ribbon Sports by Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman on January 25, 1964. 1971 The company was renamed Nike and began using the 'Swoosh' logo, created by Portland State University student Carolyn Davis, who sold Nike the logo for just $35. 1980 On December 2, 1980, Nike went public via initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ at $22 per share. 1984 The company signed Michael Jordan, launching the Air Jordan series. Within the first two months of the shoe\u2019s release, Nike sold $70 million worth of Air Jordans. 1997 Nike spun the Jordan brand into its own division featuring the 'Jumpman' logo. 2004 Nike acquired rival Converse for $309 million. Later that year, Phil Knight stepped down as CEO and president of Nike, but continued his chairman role. 2012 Nike became the official supplier for NFL apparel. 2013 Nike became a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), replacing Alcoa (AA). 2015 The company was named the official supplier for NBA apparel. 2016 Phil Knight officially stepped down from all duties with the company on June 30, 2016. 2019 In November 2019, Nike stopped selling directly through Amazon (AMZN), focusing more on direct relationships with customers. 2021 On November 5, 2021, Nike stock hit an all-time high, trading at $173.12 per share. With the stock down nearly 20% over the past year, as concerns over slowing sales growth and demand in China mount, investors are waiting for the next leg of innovation from the shoe company. From tech giants to retail titans,\u00a0Beyond the Ticker\u00a0is a historical series that takes a deep dive into some of Wall Street's trending companies and how they transformed into the financial icons they are today.

This may suggest that the company has not been generating profits effectively, which could undermine investor confidence.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Down by 0-1%\nAnalysis: While Merck & Co. has shown promising groundwork for future growth through successful collaborations and a clear commitment towards dividend hikes, the company's stock has demonstrated poor performance in comparison to competitors, which could potentially deflate investor confidence. Additionally, negative readings in EBIT per share and EPS might suggest underlying financial troubles. Given these factors, it is plausible to predict a mild downward trend in MRK's stock price for the next week. However, Merck's ability to successfully navigate these potential concerns will be crucial in determining longer-term trends. This prediction is reinforced by the fact that previous stock price trends have seen a successive decrease over the past weeks.","instruction":"Forecast for MRK in 2024-03-10 to 2024-03-17"}

This is highlighted by the company's high Gross Margin of 0.3884, high sales per share of 31.7951, and strong EPS of 5.7476.\n2. The company is also well positioned to benefit from the $1 trillion 2021 infrastructure law passed by the Biden administration, aimed at upgrading roads, bridges, and other transport infrastructure.\n3.

There is a high level of long-term debt, highlighted by a ratio of long-term-debt-to-total-asset of 0.2965 and long-term-debt-to-total-equity of 1.4077.

The company's bearish outlook for the year, coupled with a recent easing in demand for its products, orchestrates a rather pessimistic market sentiment. Moreover, further concerns are amplified by the company's elevated level of long-term debt, which could impinge upon its operational flexibility and might lead to more conservative growth strategies. Nevertheless, the company's strong financials and the upcoming dividend payment might provide some support to the stock price. Therefore, overall we can predict a modest down sentiment for next week, possibly around the range of 2-3%.","instruction":"Forecast for CAT in 2024-04-28 to 2024-05-05"}

The merger between Capital One and Discover, two of the largest credit card companies, is expected to add more competition in the payments industry.

Despite this, American Express has been consistently performing better than the broader market - an indication of strong investor confidence. Therefore, considering the balance of these factors, it can be predicted that the stock price for American Express may see an upswing of 1-2% in the next week. It's important to note that stock market investments are subject to fluctuations and it's advisable to base decisions on one's risk tolerance and financial goals.","instruction":"Forecast for AXP in 2024-03-03 to 2024-03-10"}

While there are concerns related to the loss of wealth management teams and an evident bearish trend, the recent uptick in the stock price from 182.79 to 185.80 shows a potential rebound. \n\nConsidering the company's history of robust financial performance and the stock's resilience in the face of some negative news, a short-term bounce back seems plausible. The company's diversification strategy by investing in the debt market in Sri Lanka also opens potential new revenue streams. Since recent negative developments appear to be more short-term and tactical in nature, it's reasonable to expect a 4-5% uptick in JPMorgan's stock price in the coming week.","instruction":"Forecast for JPM in 2024-04-21 to 2024-04-28"}

Verizon Communications (VZ) has recently outpaced stock market gains, indicating a strong performance within the competitive market landscape.\n2. Redburn Atlantic has upgraded VZ, further bolstering the company's reputation within the industry and likely driving consumer confidence.\n3. VZ is listed as one of the 16 most undervalued large-cap stocks according to analysts, suggesting potential for stock price growth.\n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. There is concern that VZ is reinvesting at lower rates of return, which could impact long-term financial stability and profitability.\n2. The company's recent basic financials reveal negative EBIT per share and EPS, indicating potential issues with profitability.\n3. Verizon has a relatively high long-term debt, as seen from financial ratios like longtermDebtTotalAsset, longtermDebtTotalCapital, longtermDebtTotalEquity. High debt levels may put the company in a precarious financial position, particularly in volatile market conditions.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Up by 3-4%\nAnalysis: Despite some potential concerns about profitability and high long-term debt, the overall outlook for VZ appears positive for the upcoming week. Key indicators such as the company outpacing stock market gains and the upgrade from Redburn Atlantic point to increased confidence in the company's performance. Furthermore, being included in the list of most undervalued large-cap stocks suggests room for further growth in the stock price.\n\nMoreover, while the reported negative EBIT per share and EPS may initially raise concerns, it's crucial to consider these numbers in context. The Telecommunication industry is capital intensive, often requiring significant upfront costs and ongoing expenses that may initially suppress earnings figures. These investments, however, often enable long-term growth and sustainability. \n\nTaking into account these considerations along with the broader market trends and Verizon's position within its sector, there's good reason to predict an increase of approximately 3-4% in the company's stock price for the week of March 24th to 31st, 2024.","instruction":"Forecast for VZ in 2024-03-24 to 2024-03-31"}

Visa\u2019s second-quarter results exceeded Wall Street estimates, demonstrating a reliable consumer spending habit and resilience against a potential slowing economy. This indicates a strengthened business performance and boosts investor confidence.\n2. There is a growing recognition of Visa's significant potential as a future trillion-dollar company. This generates a positive image and may attract more investors to the stock.\n3. Visa continues to repurchase its stock.

Given that Visa shares are heavily weighted in indices, any macro sell-off can negatively impact the stock.\n3. The economic recovery in Asia-Pacific is slower than expected, as reported by Visa executives. Given Visa's global presence, this could affect its revenue growth.\n4. The debt measures such as the long-term debt to total assets (0.223), long-term debt to total capital (0.3373), and total debt to equity (0.5089) are relatively high. This could indicate that Visa is significantly leveraged, which can be a risk in case of a downturn.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Down by 2-3%\nAnalysis: Based on the observed positive developments and potential risks, there is concern that the broader market correction and slowing recovery in the Asia-Pacific region could impact Visa's stock price in the short-term. Moreover, the recent decrease in the stock price might also suggest increased sell-offs. These signals raise the probability of the stock price being under pressure next week. Therefore, even with strong company fundamentals, a stock price decline of around 2-3% could be expected. Investors should closely observe the stock's performance and the broader market trends for the coming week. Moreover, the high debt ratio also adds to the caution, as these debts would create heavier financial burdens for Visa if it encounters any unanticipated economic or business difficulties. Therefore, investors should also monitor how Visa manages its high leverage situation in the longer term.","instruction":"Forecast for V in 2024-04-28 to 2024-05-05"}

Disney's collaboration with Fox on launching a new sports streaming service, jointly with ESPN and Warner Bros. Discovery, could lead to new revenue streams and place the company at the forefront of the streaming industry.\n3. The appointment of Pete Distad, a veteran executive from Apple and Disney's Hulu, as CEO of the ESPN-Fox-WBD joint venture could strongly drive the success of this operation, given his experience in the tech and media space.\n4. The company retains a strong cash ratio, showing an ability to cover immediate liabilities that might arise, thereby aiding in operational stability.\n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. The ongoing proxy fight within company\u2019s board can create uncertainty, potentially affecting strategic decision-making and overall company direction.\n2. The announcement of ValueAct earning fees for managing Disney Pension Funds, as suggested, may incur scrutiny and possible reputational damage.\n3. Despite new ventures and acquisitive growth strategies, the company's operating margin remains relatively low, suggesting potential inefficiencies in operations or high underlying costs.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Up by 3-4%\nAnalysis: Based on the recap of the recent weeks, it is plausible to predict a 3-4% rise in Walt Disney's stock for the upcoming week. This is primarily driven by the company's strategic ventures such as the merger with Reliance Industries, which allows deeper expansion into the growing Indian market, and the joint sports streaming service. Both initiatives could potentially enhance revenue streams and position the company favorably for the long term. Furthermore, the appointment of an experienced executive at the helm of the former development is very promising. However, it's also essential to monitor internal board conflicts and potential legal issues related to the company's pension funds, as these could pose risks down the line. Nonetheless, the company's solid cash position provides financial stability, which offsets some of these risks and could reassure investors.","instruction":"Forecast for DIS in 2024-03-17 to 2024-03-24"}

Significantly, the Chinese mandate to phase out foreign chips poses a noteworthy threat to its market share and future growth. Coupled with a relatively weak operational efficiency showcased by a less than desired asset turnover, it seems the company is grappling with substantial operational and market-centric challenges that could further depreciate its stock price.

This efficiency allows PG to absorb and pass on larger costs without significant impact on profitability, a critical capability in an environment where inflationary pressures continue to loom.\n\nThe recall of defective laundry detergent packets is a short-term setback, but given Procter & Gamble's rich product portfolio, it is likely to have a limited impact on its overall sales.

This is premised on potential organizational disruption due to Hammack's impending departure, compounded by the recent lower financial performance. Shareholders might react to the news of Hammack's departure with uncertainty, hence selling off their shares. Additionally, Goldman Sachs' high long-term debt to total asset ratio could indicate potential risk in the company's financial situation, which may spook investors.","instruction":"Forecast for GS in 2024-03-03 to 2024-03-10"}

Increased M&A activities in the Biotech industry could give Merck & Co an opportunity to acquire new assets and capabilities to drive growth.\n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1.

With an EPS of -0.4902, Merck & Co's profitability seems to be in question. Investors would like to see a positive EPS, which indicates the company's ability to generate profits.\n3. The company has a high longterm Debt to Total Asset ratio (0.3158) and Net Debt to Total Equity ratio (0.7508), suggesting that it might be heavily leveraged, which could potentially pose a risk for investors.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Up by more than 5%\nAnalysis: Despite the failed trial of KEYTRUDA plus LYNPARZA, it is worth noting that the pharmaceutical industry often involves high risk and high reward scenarios which may have already been priced into the stock. Merck & Co's commitment to continuous research and development is a signal that the company administrators are taking robust actions to secure their future growth.\n\nMoreover, any potential debt concerns may be offset by forthcoming strategic decisions from management to restructure the debt. Merck & Co Inc's dividend announcement also indicates that the company has an encouraging cash flow that supports the policy, which often leads to price appreciation as income investors buy into the stock.\n\nTherefore, despite some concerns, the overall outlook for Merck & Co Inc is positive. Considering these factors, it is predicted that MRK's stock price will rise by more than 5% in the week of 2024-03-24 to 2024-03-31.","instruction":"Forecast for MRK in 2024-03-24 to 2024-03-31"}

The company's long-term debt to total asset, capital, and equity ratios are relatively high, suggesting that the company is overly reliant on debt to finance its operations, which could hamper its profitability.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Down by 3-4%\nAnalysis: Considering the potential concerns, particularly the job cuts, hints of weaker profits due to reduced consumer spending and its increased dependence on debt, it's likely the stock price may experience a decrease next week. Such news may instill caution among potential investors and might impact the market sentiment negatively.\n\nThough the company is making strategic moves to boost savings and invest in areas of growth, these are long-term benefits that may not immediately reflect on the stock price. Given the prevailing circumstances, a 3-4% downward movement in the NKE stock price could occur in the week from 2024-02-25 to 2024-03-03. The company's financial health and market conditions will need to be closely monitored moving forward.","instruction":"Forecast for NKE in 2024-02-25 to 2024-03-03"}

Issues related to past talc bankruptcy filings in 2021 continue to be unresolved and persist in the courts. These legal disputes might rack up substantial costs and could result in potential negative publicity.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Up by 0-1%\nAnalysis: Given the positive and negative developments over the past weeks, mixed outcomes are projected for Johnson & Johnson. The pharmaceutical successes \u2014 including the promising trials of nipocalimab and the approval of iloprost for frostbite \u2014 could give the company a significant boost and indicate its dedication to growth and innovation. However, these gains may be offset by negative factors such as market underperformance, high-profile scrutiny over drug pricing, and ongoing legal battles.\nThe net effect of these factors might lead to minimal upward movement in JNJ's stock price, up to a modest 1%, in the upcoming week (2024-02-25 to 2024-03-03). Furthermore, considering the strong financial aspects such as high gross margin (0.6861), a modest P\/E ratio (10.7336), and a healthy ROE (0.4916) of the company, it suggests a good fundamental platform for long term investors. Further detailed and continuous examination of company fundamentals, sector trends, and broader market conditions would be advisable to keep the projections updated.\n","instruction":"Forecast for JNJ in 2024-02-25 to 2024-03-03"}

However, Intel's market standing may see some fluctuations in the future, given the geopolitical tensions and adjustments in business partnerships. These potential headwinds, though, are likely to play out over a longer time frame and should not significantly impact the short-term positive forecast.\n","instruction":"Forecast for INTC in 2024-03-24 to 2024-03-31"}

While the banks have stressed that consumers are continuing to spend despite uncertainty around inflation, there are also signs of rising consumer credit stress. Bank of America, for instance, reported that its net charge-offs \u2014 debts unlikely to be recovered \u2014 rose to $1.5 billion year over year, up from $807 million in the prior-year period.

Bailer believes that the decade following the 2008 financial crisis was an \"anomaly\" rather than the norm given how low rates had to be to spur economic growth. He says that rates have tended to skew, historically, to 4%-5% and, in that environment, value stocks tend to be what works. \"I do think that, for lots of reasons, we're going to have a little more inflation, a little higher interest rates. Money isn't going to be free any longer. And value will come back into favor,\" Bailer claims. Watch the video above to hear why Bailer says JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is a value stock to consider.

Nike's stock has underperformed the market recently, seeing its price drop on multiple occasions within short intervals.\n3. The geopolitical tensions and rising protectionism mentioned in the news might impact Nike's global operations and sales negatively.\n4. Nike's relatively high PE ratio of 30.1026 suggests that the company might be overvalued, and investors may be paying a high price for the earnings.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Up by 0-1%\nAnalysis: Despite facing some short-term volatility and market underperformance, the long-term outlook for Nike seems positive. This is backed by strong gross margin and inclusion in the list of high growth dividend stocks. Apart from this, a high quick ratio indicates good financial health and capability to pay off short-term obligations. However, concerns loom around its high PE ratio and geopolitical tensions affecting global operations. Balancing the positive developments and potential concerns, it is predicted that Nike's stock may see a slight rise of up to 1% in the upcoming week. The potential risks and challenges could be mitigated by the strong fundamentals and investor confidence, but they also prevent a more substantial rise for now. This prediction is made while factoring in the overall market conditions and the company's situation.","instruction":"Forecast for NKE in 2024-03-10 to 2024-03-17"}

This increases the demand for Salesforce's stock.\n   \n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. Notably, insiders at Salesforce, including the President and CFO Amy Weaver and the President and COO Brian Millham, have sold significant quantities of their shares. This move can be interpreted as a lack of confidence in the company's near-term prospects.\n2. The company's current price to earnings ratio (peTTM) is 65.787, which is relatively high, indicating the stock might be overvalued compared to its earnings.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Down by 2-3%\nAnalysis: Based on current developments, Salesforce's stock trend might see a downward shift in the short term. In particular, the selling of large numbers of stocks by the company's President and CFO sends a pessimistic message to investors regarding the company's prospects. Such high-profile sales often spur negative market sentiment, which may cause a downward pressure on the stock's price. \n\nMoreover, the financial metrics suggest that the company's stock might be overvaliced, given the relatively high P\/E ratio. Investors could react to this by selling off their shares, thereby reducing demand and causing the stock price to decrease. \n\nConsidering these factors, I predict a 2-3% downward movement in Salesforce\u2019s stock price for the upcoming week. The negative market sentiment from within the company, combined with potential market correction due to perceived overvaluation, could drive this downward momentum in the short term. Although long-term prospects might remain promising, short-term adjustments are to be expected in the market.","instruction":"Forecast for CRM in 2024-03-24 to 2024-03-31"}

Cisco has formed a consortium with other leading technology companies to address the impact of artificial intelligence on the technology workforce.

There is a threat from Nvidia, which is projected to overtake giants like Microsoft and possibly Cisco itself, posing competitive challenges in the tech sector.\n2. The company's stock saw a slight decrease in price over the period from 2024-03-31 to 2024-04-07.

There could be concerns about competition from Nvidia affecting the outlook for the company. Despite these fears, Cisco's strong financial standing and its concerted effort to stay ahead in tech advancement by addressing AI's impact on the workforce is commendable. However, in the short term, these positive factors may not be enough to counteract the prevailing market sentiment.\n\nGiven this mixed outlook, we predict that Cisco's stock will likely see a minor downtrend, potentially going down by 0-1%, in the next week from 2024-04-07 to 2024-04-14. This prediction takes into account the recent negative market sentiment and competition threats, but also the company's strong financials and its forward-thinking strategies.","instruction":"Forecast for CSCO in 2024-04-07 to 2024-04-14"}

Honeywell\u2019s debt ratios are moderately high with a total debt to equity of 1.2893, long term debt to total asset of 0.2676, and net debt to total equity of 0.7895.

This is factoring in potential market correction due to its high P\/E ratio and any negative news regarding its product pipeline that could incite investor anxiety. Nevertheless, the decline is not expected to be significant, given the company's potential growth prospects and attractive dividend payout strategy.","instruction":"Forecast for AMGN in 2024-04-07 to 2024-04-14"}

Typically, the final notice reflects increased rates; however, this time, CMS did not make any adjustments.

Provide a summary analysis to support your prediction.[\/INST]","output":"[Positive Developments]:\n1. IBM has a strong focus on the emerging and highly promising field of quantum computing, which could potentially revolutionize the technology industry, solve complex problems and give IBM a competitive edge over traditional computing companies.\n2. IBM's healthy dividend position can increase its appeal for dividend-focused investors, especially those who appreciate steading revenue in the uncertain stock market.\n3. IBM's free cash flow (FCF) margin is robust at 23.11%. It represents the cash a company generates after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and maintain its capital assets. The high FCF margin suggests a sustainable business model.\n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. The company's high debt ratio, with total debt to equity standing at 2.5095, suggests that it's heavily funded by debt. This can be risky in an unstable economic environment or when interest rates rise.\n2. Market news has implied that IBM's stock is overvalued, which could cause downward pressure in the near future.\n3. IBM's current ratio is 0.9644, which is below the ideal benchmark of 1. This means that the company might face difficulties meeting its short-term obligations, possibly leading to liquidity issues.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Down by 2-3%\nAnalysis: While IBM has clear positive developments like the potential in quantum computing and solid FCF margin, the potential concerns notably the company's high leverage and liquidity issues cannot be overlooked. Furthermore, if the perception of the market that IBM's stock is overvalued manifests, it could lead to a stock price correction. Factors such as these could place downward pressure on the share price. Therefore, based on these austere financial facts and the present market sentiment, IBM's stock price is predicted to see a decrease of 2-3% in the upcoming week. It is crucial to track how the balance between IBM's promising Quantum Computing developments and its financial weaknesses will impact the stock price in the long run.\n","instruction":"Forecast for IBM in 2024-03-10 to 2024-03-17"}

Boeing has seen a significant decrease in deliveries after a door plug mishap on an Alaska Airlines flight. Consequently, Boeing drastically reduced its output, with only 83 planes delivered in the first quarter compared to 130 planes during the same period the previous year.\n2. Boeing's operating margin and net margin are both negative, indicating issues in profitability and operational efficiency. \n3.

This might dent investor confidence. However, the company's relatively healthy free cash flow per share suggests that it is still capable of generating cash, a positive sign of its ongoing financial health.\n\nMoreover, considering the long-standing reputation and historical resilience of Boeing, the stock may not be significantly impacted in the short term. Investors might take into account the company's prospects in the long run once the current issues are addressed. Thus, despite some negativity, the stock price may see a small uptick of around 0-1% in the coming week.

Therefore, although a slight increase is predicted, investors must remain vigilant and flexible in their strategy. \n\nOverall, the largely favorable financials, positive news sentiment, and promising clinical trials position Amgen advantageously for potential future growth, serving as a basis for this week's stock price increase prediction.","instruction":"Forecast for AMGN in 2024-04-21 to 2024-04-28"}

With a payout ratio of more than 100%(1.1343), DOW is paying out more in dividends than it is making in net income, which could be a concern for its future dividend sustainability or its reinvestment potential.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Down by 1-2%\nAnalysis: Despite the positive developments in DOW\u2019s product and partnership expansion, financial analysis suggests that there may be some concerns regarding its financial health. The company's reported high long-term debt ratio indicates a substantial debt burden, which could impact the company's performance if not managed properly. More importantly, a payout ratio of over 100% suggests that earnings are not sufficient to cover its dividend payment. This is a red flag that either dividend is not sustainable or the company doesn't have enough to reinvest in business growth. This tension may lead to negative investor sentiment in the short term.\n\nGiven these concerns and the recent surge in stock price, it's conceivable that a portion of investors might be looking to lock in profits, leading to increased selling pressure in the week ahead. While the company\u2019s strategic partnerships and innovative product portfolio bode well for the long-term future, these concerns may cause a slight decrease in the stock price in the upcoming week by 1-2%.","instruction":"Forecast for DOW in 2024-04-14 to 2024-04-21"}

Travelers Companies Inc was mentioned as one of the largest insurance companies in the world in 2024, indicating its significant position and influence in the insurance sector, which can boost investor's confidence.\n2. The company's basic financial figures depict a robust fiscal position. It boasts a decent return on equity (ROE) of 13.32% and a comparatively lower debt to equity ratio of 0.3223, indicating a sustainable debt level.\n3.

With the payout ratio at 0.225, some investors might be deterred if they are seeking higher dividend returns.\n \n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Up by 2-3%\nAnalysis: Based on the aforementioned insights, it is probable that Travelers Companies Inc's stock price might observe an upward trajectory in the upcoming week, possibly up by 2-3%. Despite some existing concerns, the positives seemingly outweigh the negatives. Its recognition as one of the largest insurance companies globally, along with strong financialit performance (especially its ROE and manageable debt levels), are likely to instil confidence in the investors. The robust FCF per Share also highlights robust financial health that could significantly drive the stock price. Moreover, the current market landscape with growing demand for insurance could further fuel the bullish run. Therefore, it is anticipated that these factors might contribute to the stock's value appreciation. However, investors should also keep an eye on its liquidity position and payout ratio for a balanced interpretation and decision making.","instruction":"Forecast for TRV in 2024-03-24 to 2024-03-31"}

Provide a summary analysis to support your prediction.[\/INST]","output":"[Positive Developments]:\n1. IBM has been receiving positive news coverage, including a considerable rally fueled by optimism surrounding their AI developments. This indicates a positive outlook on the company's future performance.\n2. The partnership between the Government of Spain and IBM for developing AI models, as well as the company's persistent movement in the quantum computing realm, bring new opportunities and avenues for growth.\n3. Financial data highlights high free cash flow per share (13.7672), a decent operating margin (0.0743), and a strong return on equity (0.3593), suggesting efficient operations and profitability.\n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. IBM's total debt to equity and total debt to total asset ratios are high (2.5581 and 0.4338 respectively), indicating the company carries a significant amount of debt.\n2. The cash ratio (0.4508) is less than 1, suggesting that the company might struggle to cover its short-term liabilities.\n3. Its price-to-earnings ratio (peTTM: 21.2719) is slightly high, indicating that the stock may be overpriced compared to its earnings.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Down by 3-4%\nAnalysis: While positive news coverage and promising partnerships indicate a strong future potential for IBM, the company's financial health is somewhat concerning given the high amounts of debt it carries. Coupled with an inflated price-to-earnings ratio, this suggests the stock may currently be overvalued. \n\nOn the operational front, while it has a healthy operating margin and strong ROE, a cash ratio less than 1 may indicate liquidity concerns. Therefore, in the short run, there is some risk around the company's ability to cover immediate liabilities, which could affect stock performance. \n\nConsidering these factors, I predict that IBM's stock price may experience a downward adjustment in the range of 3-4% over the next week. This prediction assumes no other major market influences or company-specific news during that timeframe. Despite these possible short-term declines, the company's strategic focus on AI, quantum computing, and its positive news coverage point to favorable long-term prospects if it can improve its financial health.","instruction":"Forecast for IBM in 2024-04-07 to 2024-04-14"}

Additionally, Chevron\u2019s commitment to the renewable energy transition presents lucrative future growth opportunities in an industry faced with increasing regulatory, environmental, and social pressures.\n\nHowever, the fact Chevron's stock underwent a loss in the previous trading session presents a concern. While it could be a natural market fluctuation, it may also prelude a downward trend in the short term.

However, this should not be seen as a long-term downturn, as the company's strong fundamentals and strategic decisions position it well for future growth.

Coca-Cola is consistently highlighted as a Proven Dividend King, indicating stability and reliable returns for investors.\n2. Coca-Cola was mentioned among the stocks to gain the most from the highly popular event March Madness, which could result in enhanced income and brand presence.\n3. The push towards healthier product alternatives, such as zero-sugar sweet tea, aligns with consumer trends towards health-conscious purchasing decisions. \n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. There are growing doubts around whether the Federal Reserve will deliver on the rate cuts that market participants are expecting, potentially causing an overall market downturn.\n2. A contrasting article suggested buying Pepsi before Coca-Cola, indicating potential challenges or lesser growth opportunities.\n3. High long term debt compared to the total asset (0.3638) and a high payout ratio (0.7422) might put future dividends at risk.\n\n[Prediction and Analysis]:\n\nThe overall positive sentiments surrounding Coca-Cola's engagement with popular events like March Madness and its strategic moves towards healthier product options provide a solid foundation for its business growth. However, the lingering concerns about the overall market downturn due to uncertainties in federal rate cuts, increased competition from peers like Pepsi Co, and the high long-term debt might led to investor caution. \n\nWhile Coca-Cola has a strong market presence and dividend history, which could attract long-term and income-oriented investors, the negatives within both the company and the broader market might cast a shadow over investor sentiment in the short term. Therefore, based on these analysis, the prediction for Coca Cola's stock price movement for the upcoming week might likely be a modest downtick of around 2-3%.","instruction":"Forecast for KO in 2024-03-31 to 2024-04-07"}

Verizon is showcasing its technologies in significant events such as the Mobile World Congress Barcelona and ViVE 2024, indicating its emphasis on innovation and enhancing market visibility.\n2. Analysts are expressing interest in Verizon as a high-yield entity providing steady income, which may be attractive to long-term value-driven investors.\n3. Verizon's FCF per share TTM at 3.0712 suggests it has been generating cash effectively, which could be used for investments, dividends, or debt repayment.\n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. There are concerns regarding whether Verizon's 6.6% dividend yield can be sustained, especially in the face of rising interest rates.\n2. Verizon's long-term debt to asset ratio (0.3621) and long-term debt to capital ratio (0.5664) are relatively high, indicating the company might be burdened with debt.\n3. Verizon's negative EPS (-0.6415) implies that the company was not profitable in the past year.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Down by 1-2%\nAnalysis: Given the above developments and concerns, the stock price of Verizon is predicted to slightly decrease by 1-2% in the upcoming week. The key driving factor behind this prediction is the sustainability concern around the high dividend yield, which could make investors cautious and potentially lead to selling pressure. \n\nFurthermore, the company's high debt burden might limit its ability to execute strategic plans and withstand financial downturns, both of which are construed as risk factors for the investors. Finally, the negative EPS raises concerns regarding Verizon's profitability. All these factors might put downward pressure on the stock price.\n\nAt the same time, the positive developments could partially offset the decline. The company's robust innovation initiatives reflected in its recent showcases at industry events could strengthen its brand reputation and influence. Alongside, the analysts' interest in Verizon as a high-yield stock could draw in value-driven investors. Despite these, the concerns seem to outweigh the positives and hence, lead to the prediction of a slight decline in the price for the upcoming week.","instruction":"Forecast for VZ in 2024-03-03 to 2024-03-10"}

Recent minor stock price declines could suggest shaky investor confidence.\n2. The market is seeing an influx of new companies filing for IPOs, potentially leading to competition, which may divert investors' interest.\n3.

Despite the solid gross margin and potential opportunities stemming from the acquisition of Shockwave Medical, concerns overshadow these positives. The recent minor price decline might have stemmed from shaky investor confidence, which, coupled with an influx of IPOs, could dilute the interest in JNJ and impact its stock price negatively. Moreover, the speculated buyout of Cytokinetics, if doesn't materialize, could hurt the company's market reputation leading to an adverse effect on the stock price. Hence, a softening of the stock's price over the next week could be expected.","instruction":"Forecast for JNJ in 2024-04-07 to 2024-04-14"}

The steady growth in the stock price, alongside the valuation from analysts suggesting a significant underpricing, gives a bullish signal about the stock price direction. The interest from leading hedge funds offers further validation of this perspective. Moreover, the successful use of AI in the sector underscores the potential for Salesforce's performance to improve from technology integration, assuming it follows a similar path. However, there are legitimate concerns - the potential volatility around earnings release, regular underperformance compared to competitors, and questions about profitability drawn from AI integration. Nevertheless, weighing the positive signals against the potential concerns, the likelihood seems to be for the stock price to trend upward, possibly beyond 5% in the upcoming week.","instruction":"Forecast for CRM in 2024-02-25 to 2024-03-03"}

Even though there have been mixed trading sessions, CAT has shown resilience with an upward trend in the stock price. This shows investor confidence and a strong buy sentiment, which could result in increased demand and cause a stock price increase.\n\nThe note of caution would be the potentially overvalued industrial sector and CAT's underperformance compared to its peers in certain sessions. However, the company's financials indicate solid growth and overall profitability, which can assuage overvaluation concerns. Potential volatility and price corrections in the market have also been witnessed, resulting in some losses. However, these losses provide opportunities for investors to buy the dip, which could put upward pressure on CAT's stock price.\n\nThe company's position as one of the growth stocks that investors regret not buying in 2024 is a strong indicator of future growth prospects. CAT's prediction in industry growth and its solid position in the market makes the stock an attractive buy, which can push the price higher.\n\nIt's, therefore, reasonable to predict a rise in CAT's share price next week, by 3-4%, based on these factors. However, investors should also keep an eye on the market trends and factors that could contribute to potential volatility.","instruction":"Forecast for CAT in 2024-02-25 to 2024-03-03"}

Although the collaboration with Krispy Kreme has potential, uncertainties around its full execution add to downward pressure on stock prices. Also, the intense competition McDonald's faces in the market may further discourage investment, contributing to a potential drop in stock prices in the coming week.","instruction":"Forecast for MCD in 2024-03-31 to 2024-04-07"}

Recent headlines have indicated consumer-facing companies, including Nike, are facing challenges which may impact profitability.\n2. Comparison against primary competitors such as Lululemon, which has been noted to have unwarranted selling, may indicate potential market worries for Nike as well.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Up by 3-4%\nAnalysis: Regarding Nike's financial position, the company has demonstrated a strong cash ratio, suggesting it has the necessary liquidity to mitigate short-term challenges. Furthermore, they maintain a robust gross margin indicating healthy profitability for each unit of sale.\n\nAlthough the headlines raise some concerns about the overall condition of the consumer-facing sector, the dismissal of the greenwashing case against Nike presents a positive spin on the company's integrity and dedication to sustainability. Such public acquittal could encourage increased consumer trust and potentially drive sales.\n\nMoreover, while market sensitivity has seen Nike shares trending down along with Lululemon, Lululemon's recent analyst report suggesting the selling is unwarranted may bode well for Nike as the market corrects these potentially inflated fears. It may signal investors' potential undervaluation of these key players in the Apparel & Luxury Goods sector. \n\nThis, coupled with Nike's strong fundamentals and the potential uplift from the court case dismissal, suggests potential for stock price recovery and, therefore, an increase by 3-4% in the upcoming week can be reasonably predicted.

Amgen's new 52-week results from the Phase 3 SPROUT study examining the use of Otezla in children and adolescents with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis showcased positive prospects. These advancements in their medical trials can potentially lead to further revenue growth.\n2. There is industry expectation that the biotech sector could benefit once rates start to come down, as mentioned by Jared Ablass, VP, Portfolio Research at TD Asset Management. This potential shift may be advantageous for Amgen.\n3. The market undervalues Amgen, according to some analysts. This suggests the stock may have upside potential.\n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed invalidity of two Amgen patents based on a lack of enablement, potentially threatening the company's competitive edge. This development can affect future earnings.\n2. Amgen's stock has underperformed when compared to its competitors in recent weeks, signaling pessimism among investors.\n3. The financial figure shows a high long-term debt-to-equity ratio (10.3679), which could raise concerns about the company's financial health.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Up by 2-3%\nAnalysis: Despite the potential concerns, the positive developments notably outweigh them. The new promising results from the company's medical trials sprout positive anticipation and reflect the company's capacity to innovate and set industry standards. Coupled with anticipation of benefiting from a decrease in rates in the biotech sector and the undervalued market position, these factors set the stage for likely positive price movement.\n\nHowever, it's important to note the potential risks facing Amgen, such as patent invalidity and underperformance relative to competitors, which can lead to cautious investor behavior. The financial health indicator of high long-term debt-to-equity ratio needs to be monitored, too.\n\nTaking all these into account, it seems reasonable to forecast a modest 2-3% stock price increase for AMGN in the week of 2024-03-17 to 2024-03-24. This view is subject to review as new information emerges, particularly those regarding the company's ongoing phase 3 trial and market sentiment in the biotech sector.\n","instruction":"Forecast for AMGN in 2024-03-17 to 2024-03-24"}

The event provoked a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) audit, which revealed multiple failures to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements.

Boyd outlines key priorities for Boeing's new leadership: \"The day one priority has to clean upwhat's gone on in manufacturing. Look, as I pointed out, in an airline, if you fix an airplane, the mechanic has to fix it. You have to know who it is. He signs off...Then an inspector comes in and signs off. What we found out now is that is not what Boeing was doing. They can't tell you who worked on that airplane that Alaska (ALK) had the problem with. That is outrageous. An airline would get shut down for that.

The company's investment in ION Clean Energy, a company that provides carbon capture technology, shows Chevron's effort in transitioning to renewable energy and potentially benefiting from increasing global demand.\n2. Positive sentiments are shown in articles such as \"3 Absurdly Cheap Warren Buffett Stocks That Are No-Brainer Buys Right Now\" and \"15 Best Energy Stocks To Buy Now\", which suggests that investors are considering CVX as an undervalued and potentially profitable stock.\n3. The company is being recognized for its clean energy profile and its potential to benefit from the US clean energy transition.\n4. Chevron's strong fundamentals and cash flows, as well as its high dividend yield, make it an attractive investment option for income investors.\n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. There has been an increased gap between compensation for executives and Chevron's workers, signaled by the 12% rise in CEO's pay while employees' raise lagged. This could cause dissatisfaction among employees and potentially impact productivity.\n2. The U.S. sanction relief on Venezuela's oil may not continue which could potentially affect oil prices and ultimately Chevron's profits.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Up by 3-4%\nAnalysis: Despite potential concerns, the outlook for Chevron Corp appears to be optimistic. The company's recent investments in clean energy, and its recognition in benefiting from the clean energy transition, reflect not only Chevron's adaptability to global demand shift towards renewables but also its potential to increase its market share in the future energy market. In addition, Warren Buffett owning the stock gives investors confidence \u2013 as he is known for his value-investing strategy.\n\nFurthermore, the financial analysis reflects that Chevron has solid fundamentals. Its EBIT per share of 1.4271 and EPS of 1.2101 shows the company's profitability. With a payout ratio TTM of 0.5305, Chevron is able to return nearly half of its profits to shareholders in the form of dividends, making it an attractive dividend-paying company in the market.\n\nTaking these positive developments into account, while acknowledging potential concerns \u2013 the subsequent week could see an uptick in Chevron's stock price by around 3-4% as investors gain confidence in buy sentiments. Future developments in clean energy transition and employee satisfaction will have to be monitored. Nonetheless, the company direction and solid fundamentals have the potential to drive strong performance in the near future.\n","instruction":"Forecast for CVX in 2024-04-21 to 2024-04-28"}

This acquisition bolsters the company's professional services business and expands its market access and capabilities.\n2. President Joe Biden\u2019s advisers have encouraged big employers like Home Depot to retain jobs despite the closure of Baltimore's port due to a bridge collapse. This political support may help the company maintain its operational efficiency.\n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. The company's stock price decreased in consecutive weeks at the end of March and the start of April, indicating a potential downward trend. Negative market sentiment may be causing investors to offload their shares, exacerbating the downward movement.\n2. The company's total debt to equity ratio is excessively high, reaching 42.25 which indicates a high level of financial risk. This heavy debt load could lead to solvency problems if revenues decline.\n3. The recent downturn in the economy and construction industry may be negatively affecting the company's business.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Down by 4-5%\nAnalysis: Home Depot's recent acquisition of SRS could be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it expands the company's access and capabilities in the market. On the other hand, it significantly adds to the company's already high debt burden. If the resultant rise in debt is not properly managed, it could lead to potential solvency problems for the company, especially in the face of potential economic downturns.\n\nIn addition, the company's consistent stock price decline in recent weeks indicates negative investor sentiment towards the company, leading to a potential further decrease in its stock price in the near future.\n\nThe company has a high total debt to equity ratio, which indicates that it has been financing its growth with debt. In a weak market or economic downturn, it could provide investors a reason to sell, further driving down the share price.\n\nGiven the current economic situation, combined with the high level of debt and declining stock prices, it would not be surprising to see this assertive downward trend continue into next week, potentially resulting in the stock price declining by around 4-5%.","instruction":"Forecast for HD in 2024-04-07 to 2024-04-14"}

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has been appointed by Tutor Perini Corp. to help it address upcoming maturities and refinance its debt, implying that Goldman Sachs has retained its credibility and reputation in the market.\n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley now face an investors' lawsuit over the Archegos collapse, which may lead to reputational damage and financial loss.\n2. The firm may experience staff instability, as indicated by Philip Berlinski's departure for Millennium Management.\n3. The company's stock price has been on a consistent decline.\n\n[Prediction and Analysis]:\n\nDespite several challenges, the upward revision of China's economic growth forecast and the confidence exuded by its CEO suggest a potential improvement in performance. More importantly, its new partnership with Tutor Perini Corp. indicates trust in its financial management abilities.\n\nFurthermore, even though the investors' lawsuit over the Archegos collapse presents a considerable risk, the financial impact of this isn't clear yet, and it could be mitigated by their robust financials, specifically indicated by their higher ebitPerShare and robust margins which are grossMargin of 0.3954 and netMargin at 0.1285.\n\nThe departure of a key executive does present a challenge. However, this is common in the industry and may be absorbed over time, given the firm's size and capabilities. Given these circumstances, and although the stock has seen a downward trend, we predict an upward correction for Goldman Sachs' share price. For the upcoming week, it's quite plausible the stock price could see an increase of around 3-4%.","instruction":"Forecast for GS in 2024-04-14 to 2024-04-21"}

Microsoft plans to invest $2.9 billion over the next two years to boost its artificial intelligence business in Japan. This aggressive investment sends a positive message to the market regarding Microsoft's long-term growth strategy. \n2. AI is going to impact jobs, but any impacts could potentially provide an opportunity for Microsoft to flex its technological prowess and competitive position within the AI sector. \n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. Investing $2.9 billion by Microsoft in Japan's AI business may not yield immediate profitability, which could raise concerns among short-term investors, contributing to a potential dip in the stock price. \n2. The Dow Jones Index's future and the market rally signals a new run with other AI stocks including Nvidia. Intense competition in the AI space from other tech giants may limit Microsoft's overall growth in this sector. \n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Down by more than 5%\nAnalysis: Based on the news and financials, the Microsoft stock price may experience a decrease in the next week. Microsoft's commitment to investing $2.9 billion in its AI business in Japan, signals a significant capital outflow with uncertain short-term returns. This could potentially strike a chord with risk-averse investors and lead to an immediate drop in the stock\u2019s value.\n\nMoreover, the company's PE ratio of 33.86 suggests the shares may be somewhat overvalued at the current share price. This, combined with increased competition in the market from other AI companies could eventually lead to a selloff, contributing to a decrease in the stock price.\n\nHowever, it's important to keep in mind that Microsoft's investment in AI could potentially yield substantial returns in the long term. Hence, this predicted drop in stock price could be a temporary setback as the market adjusts to this news. Investors with a long-term perspective might view any potential drop in share price as an opportunity to buy.","instruction":"Forecast for MSFT in 2024-04-14 to 2024-04-21"}

Increased focus on marketing activities: Nike is ramping up its marketing efforts ahead of the upcoming Olympic Games.

Disney has announced its strategic merger with Reliance Industries combining its India business operations. This collaboration will significantly enhance its business reach in India, which is a substantial market.\n2. Disney's decision to raise the cost of its cheapest tickets for the first time in six years indicates a strong demand for its theme parks, hinting at optimism for future revenues. \n3. The joint sports streaming venture involving Disney's ESPN has been subject to scrutiny, but general consensus among market pundits indicates the fears of its potential downsides may be overblown.\n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. Despite the control takeover declared as a 'success' by Governor DeSantis, Disney has experienced an exodus of workers, ongoing litigations and scandals surrounding the management. This may affect staff morale and eventually productivity.\n2. The initiatives to reduce free trial periods could hamper subscriber acquisition and retention for Disney's streaming services. As streaming platforms are a significant contributor to Disney's revenues, these changes could impact their financial performance.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Down by 1-2%\nAnalysis: Given the recent developments, I predict that Disney's stock will experience a slight downtrend of 1-2% in the coming week. The negative sentiments surrounding the changes in management and possible disruption in streaming services might lead to investor caution. While the potential of the joint venture and the ticket price increment denote a bright future, the immediate concerns revolving around staff exodus and litigation could put pressure on the stock price in the short term. Furthermore, the price earnings (P\/E) ratio indicating stock valuation is relatively high at around 55, suggesting that the stock might be overpriced. This high valuation could contribute to a price correction in the near term, adding to the downward movement in its stock price for the approaching week. Hence, careful monitoring of these key issues is required for investors and stockholders.","instruction":"Forecast for DIS in 2024-03-03 to 2024-03-10"}

Senate investigations and forthcoming fines towards Boeing's partner, Asia Pacific Airlines, may adversely affect the market sentiment and investor confidence. Despite the positive development concerning Alaska Air's projected Q2 profit, it may not be strong enough to offset the potential concerns. Moreover, Boeing's current financial statistics like a negative EBIT per share and EPS, lower asset turnover, and a high total debt to total asset ratio all suggest potential financial risk, which further strengthens the probability of a downward trend for the coming week. In conclusion, the negative developments outweigh the positive ones, leading to the prediction of a drop in Boeing's stock price for the next week.\n","instruction":"Forecast for BA in 2024-04-21 to 2024-04-28"}

Moses explained that food inflation has been propelled by the COVID-19 pandemic, global ecological shortages, and geopolitical tensions. However, he notes that food manufacturers \"continuously taking price increases\" have further fueled the situation. Conversely, Moses highlights companies like Kroger (KR) that are \"clearly committed\" to maintaining affordable prices to assist \"millions of families\" in combating food inflation. To achieve lower prices, Moses suggests that supermarket grocers \"need to get bigger\" in the long term to compete with national discount grocers like Target (TGT) and Walmart (WMT), which currently dominate over 60% of the market share.\u00a0 For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.

Disneyland's commitment to switch to electric cars, which is part of the company's effort to push for more sustainable and environmentally friendly practices and is likely to appeal to younger, eco-conscious consumers.\n2. Despite economic uncertainties, Disney is listed as one of the most popular stocks on the Robinhood trading platform, indicating positive investor sentiment.\n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. Repercussions of Nelson Peltz's unsuccessful proxy battle at Disney could negatively impact investor confidence in the company's management and its future performance.\n2. The desire of Disneyland characters to unionize could lead to labor issues and increased operation costs.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Up by 0-1%\nAnalysis: There are a few mixed factors influencing Disney's stock, including potential labor union challenges, a failed proxy war, and its commitment to sustainability. Still, the company remains a popular choice among the investors, as pointed out by its ranking on Robinhood. Looking at the financials, some metrics such as earnings per share (EPS) of 1.0414 and free cash flow margin of 0.0376 showcase the company\u2019s profitability and cash generating ability respectively. Also, the company\u2019s asset turnover ratio is reasonably high, indicating that Disney can effectively utilize its assets to generate sales.\n\nDespite some of the near-term headwinds, Walt Disney is still a solid company with a strong reputation and a competitive position in the media industry. The potential negative sentiments seem somewhat offset by the positive aspects, suggesting the possibility of a relatively stable stock price movement in the short-term. Therefore, for the next week (2024-04-21 to 2024-04-28), I predict that Disney's stock price will move upwards by a minimal range of 0-1%. This is a conservative estimate, factoring potential downward pressure from the labor unionization news and potential fallout from the proxy battle. The media giant\u2019s robust financial health and its popularity among investors will possibly contribute to a slight uptrend. As always, investors should incorporate this prediction with their research before making investment decisions.","instruction":"Forecast for DIS in 2024-04-21 to 2024-04-28"}

Provide a summary analysis to support your prediction.[\/INST]","output":"[Positive Developments]:\n1. The company backed digital marketing firm Ibotta had a successful IPO, with its shares surging 33% in the NYSE debut, representing a solid investment for Walmart.\n2. They are teaming up with Basketball icon, Sheryl Swoopes, for promoting healthcare equity and access, demonstrating their commitment towards societal concerns.\n3. The potential establishment of Walmart labs could be seen as a step forward in their digital\/technical innovations.\n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. Despite the soaring shares of Ibotta in its IPO, the stock price of Walmart moved negatively, which indicates the market's mixed reaction to the association of Walmart with Ibotta.\n2. The company's current and quick ratios are less than 1, indicating a potential liquidity problem that could impact their short-term obligations.\n3. The fall of Walmart's stock price in the week ending 24th April, despite no substantial negative news, reflects a potential concern affecting investor sentiment.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Up by 1-2%\nAnalysis: The positive developments outweigh the potential concerns for Walmart. The successful debut of Ibotta, although did not immediately reflect in Walmart's share price, accentuates their diversification strategy and their potential earnings from this investment. Additionally, the partnership with Sheryl Swoopes could better their public image, indirectly leading to improved financial performance.\n\nConsidering the financial ratios, while the liquidity ratios may seem problematic, Walmart's high inventory turnover ratio suggests that they can quickly convert their inventories to cash, mitigating short-term liquidity concerns. Moreover, it's healthy margins, and return ratios show strength in operational efficiency and profitability, which are critical to drive the stock price up.\n\nTherefore, based on these examinations, I predict a 1-2% rise in Walmart's stock price for the week of the 21st to the 28th of April, 2024. However, investors should monitor Walmart's associations with other entities like Ibotta and watch for any signs of liquidity problems.","instruction":"Forecast for WMT in 2024-04-21 to 2024-04-28"}

This potentially signifies a growing interest in the company's market dynamics and could drive up trading volume and the stock price.\n2. Even though the company's shares have come under pressure earlier this year, some analysts still consider it a compelling bargain buy due to its high-yield dividend returns.\n3. The company continues to innovate and drive progress in the Biotechnology space, possibly indicating strong future prospects.\n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. An analyst estimate indicated a potential decline in Amgen's upcoming earnings report, which could negatively affect investor perception and stock price.\n2. General market trends indicate a modest earnings decline of 5.6% in the health care sector, which could potentially affect Amgen's stock performance.\n3. The company's significant long-term debt, as reflected in ratios such as longtermDebtTotalEquity and totalDebtToEquity is a concern, indicating potential liquidity problems and increasing financial risk.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Up by 1-2%\nAnalysis: Despite the potential concerns, the continued interest from the market, perceived undervaluation, and status as a high-yield dividend stock may support a slight uptrend in the week ahead. Amgen's continuous efforts in driving innovation and contributing to the Biotechnology sector may also reinforce investor confidence. Considering these factors alongside the general market dynamics, a 1-2% rise in Amgen's stock price during the week of April 28 to May 5, 2024, can be cautiously anticipated. However, the extension of this trend will heavily depend on the actual earnings results and how the company addresses its financial health, specifically related to its debt management.","instruction":"Forecast for AMGN in 2024-04-28 to 2024-05-05"}

No 2% pullback in the last 100 trading days. So, in recent weeks, we put on a 2% hedge: 1% put spreads on the S&P, 1% put spreads on the semiconductor index, and 98% long.

And it seems they're determined to cut. We've drawn an analogy to the 90s. We think you can have higher inflation, but not materially higher.

While there have been some positive developments for the company, such as outperforming competitors on difficult trading days and an overall increase since the last earnings report, some factors may negatively impact investor sentiment. \n\nFirstly, news of the company's underperformance relative to competitors might sow doubts among investors about its future profitability. This could potentially trigger a sell-off among shareholders, leading to a downward pressure on the stock price. \n\nSecondly, financials show that McDonald's has a relatively high long-term debt ratio. High debt levels can lead to increased financial risk, as the company may struggle to meet its obligations or face higher borrowing costs. This, in turn, could affect the company's profitability and deter hesitant investors, leading to a decrease in the demand for the stock and subsequently its price.\n\nLastly, the stock's price-earnings ratio is higher than the market average, which suggests that the stock may be overpriced. This overvaluation could decrease the appeal of the stock to potential investors who may consider it too expensive, which could lead to decreased demand and a drop in the stock price. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that while we expect a drop in the upcoming week due to these factors, the outlook for McDonald's in the long run may still be favorable given its resilient performance and positive reports.","instruction":"Forecast for MCD in 2024-03-10 to 2024-03-17"}

The company is continuing to invest substantially in expansion, notably preparing to invest $172 million in Mexico to enhance its market share. Home Depot's long-term strategy of diversifying and expanding its operations could contribute to revenue growth.\n3.

The price to earnings ratio of HD is 23.3781, which is quite high compared to other stocks in the same category. This may mean the higher valuation of HD might be due to the expectation of future growth, but it could also signal that the stock is overvalued.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Down by 0-1%\nAnalysis: Considering the negative aspects such as a high debt-to-equity ratio and a continuous decrease in stock prices, the company might face some challenges in the short term. The high valuation indicated by the P\/E ratio can also leave less room for capital appreciation causing less interest among new investors in the company. However, Home Depot's investment for expansion and its recognition for cultural inclusivity demonstrate the company's positive long-term strategy and a broader consumer base. Therefore, these developments are unlikely to immediately deal with or reverse the potential downside pressures. So, it's predicted that next week (2024-04-21 to 2024-04-28), HD's stock price is likely to continue its downturn with a decrease of approximately 0-1%. However, I'd recommend investors to closely watch HD's moves, especially its debt situation and the results of overseas expansions, which are key factors that could shift the course of the stock price in the long term.","instruction":"Forecast for HD in 2024-04-21 to 2024-04-28"}

Investors in ViacomCBS and other stocks once held by Bill Hwang's Archegos Capital Management have been granted permission to sue Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, potentially causing financial loss and damage to the bank's reputation.\n3. Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services recommends shareholders to vote in favor of a measure to separate the chairman and CEO roles at Goldman Sachs, potentially causing internal management disruption.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Down by 4-5%\nAnalysis: I predict that Goldman Sachs' stock price might decrease by 4-5% in the upcoming week due to the series of legal challenges and potential management changes that the firm is currently facing. The legal case in Malaysia and the lawsuit by ViacomCBS investors could have significant financial implications for Goldman Sachs, possibly leading to substantial legal fees and penalties. Furthermore, the recommendation to separate the roles of chairman and CEO could create uncertainty within the company's management structure. This internal instability, coupled with the ongoing legal issues, could significantly impact investor confidence, causing a short-term dip in the stock price. Despite positive developments including fund raising and strategic investments, these potential risks are likely to weigh on the stock price in the near term.","instruction":"Forecast for GS in 2024-04-07 to 2024-04-14"}

Most notably, the financial indicators point towards harmful liquidity and gearing risks. Given this, it is seen that the company has a heavy reliance on debt for its operations, which could hamper its profitability in the long term. Additionally, increased competition in the sector could lead to a loss in market share for Verizon and hamper growth, potentially impacting the stock prices negatively.\n\nVerizon's returns on capital for the foreseeable future also seem to be of concern. This implies that the capital invested into the company might not yield the desired results, thereby impacting investor sentiment. Thus, given the conglomerate of these concerns, it could potentially lead to a decrease in the stock price for the upcoming week. I predict a downtrend of around 2-3% based on these factors. However, this prediction needs to be corroborated with further analysis as the week progresses, and more news and financial results become available. Overall, the company would need to mitigate these risks and increase its financial health to attract more investors and ensure price stability.","instruction":"Forecast for VZ in 2024-04-21 to 2024-04-28"}

Nike's (NKE) slogan and 'Swoosh' logo that defines the iconic brand is now a staple for footwear, athletic apparel, and pop culture. The company generated more than $51 billion in revenue in 2023, an increase of about $4.5 billion year-over-year. Let's take a closer look at Nike's biggest moments with Beyond the Ticker, which charts its path to becoming a global icon. 1964 Nike was originally founded as Blue Ribbon Sports by Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman on January 25, 1964. 1971 The company was renamed Nike and began using the 'Swoosh' logo, created by Portland State University student Carolyn Davis, who sold Nike the logo for just $35. 1980 On December 2, 1980, Nike went public via initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ at $22 per share. 1984 The company signed Michael Jordan, launching the Air Jordan series. Within the first two months of the shoe\u2019s release, Nike sold $70 million worth of Air Jordans. 1997 Nike spun the Jordan brand into its own division featuring the 'Jumpman' logo. 2004 Nike acquired rival Converse for $309 million.

Warring upgrades Lululemon to a Strong Buy rating, explaining that the current stock pressure is an opportunity given Lululemon's continued strong margins. Regarding Nike, Warring expresses skepticism, stating that it is challenging to see where the company can find \"its next level of growth.\" Although Nike is a worldwide brand, he believes its market is saturated and international markets are growing weaker.

Visa Inc has recently reached a landmark settlement with U.S. merchants, thus ending nearly 20 years of litigation. The settlement promises lower credit interchange rates and caps on those rates until 2030, giving merchants a stronger incentive to continue partnering with Visa Inc.\n2. The rise in consumer spending and the acceleration of the cashless payment trend will likely benefit Visa greatly, as it is one of the leading providers of cashless payment solutions.\n3. The collaboration between Visa and Skipify to enhance the customer checkout experience shows Visa's commitment to improving its services and staying at the forefront of the sector.\n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. Even though Visa has agreed to lower interchange fees to settle a long-standing dispute with U.S. merchants, this may impact the company's margins and profitability in the short term.\n2. The potential downgrade of Visa's stock could undermine investors' confidence.\n3. While the cashless trend might support Visa's growth, the emergent competitive landscape with new fintech companies entering the market could pose significant threats.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Down by 0-1%\nAnalysis: The long-term outlook for Visa remains robust given its strong position in the growing cashless payment industry, reflected in growing revenues, transactions, and net profits. The settlement with U.S. merchants, while potentially affecting short-term profitability, removes a significant legal risk, offering the company newfound stability. Moreover, partnerships undertaken to streamline client experiences further demonstrate Visa's dedication to continuous innovation. However, despite these positive developments, investor sentiments might be a bit shaky in the short term due to recent news around potential stock downgrade. Considering these factors, the stock price movement for Visa might see a minor downward correction (0-1%) in the upcoming week.","instruction":"Forecast for V in 2024-04-07 to 2024-04-14"}

This suggests that the company is heavily indebted and possibly overvalued.

This is because, in the short run, financial market participants may weigh the firm's weaknesses more heavily than its strengths. The higher level of debt may suppress the firm's value as it implies potential financial distress. Furthermore, if the market deems the company to be overpriced, this might lead to a market correction, leading to a decrease in its stock price. Lastly, any negative changes in the US economic outlook might directly impact the company's stock price.","instruction":"Forecast for TRV in 2024-04-07 to 2024-04-14"}

Johnson & Johnson received FDA approval for RYBREVANT in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with EGFR Exon 20 Insertion Mutations. This could potentially drive sales growth.\n2. Johnson & Johnson was listed as a 'Dividend King' due to its ability to increase their dividend for at least 50 consecutive years, indicating a strong and stable financial performance.\n\n[Potential Concerns]:\n1. Several recent market trading sessions have underperformed for Johnson & Johnson, leading to a decrease in stock price over the past week.\n2. The company faced a mistrial in Florida state court over claims that their talc products cause cancer. While this is not a definitive loss, the uncertainty could negatively impact shareholder sentiment and stock price in the short term.\n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Down by 0-1%\nAnalysis: In the short term, the negative sentiments surrounding the recent underperformance in the market and the ongoing legal challenges related to their talc products could place downwards pressure on the stock price. While the recent FDA approval and its status as a Dividend King are certainly positive, they may not be able to fully offset the negative effects in the upcoming week. Consequently, it is predicted that Johnson & Johnson's stock price could trend slightly downwards by 0-1% over the next week. However, in the long term, the company's robust financial performance and consistent growth potential indicated by consistent dividend increases and new product approvals could help recover its stock price.","instruction":"Forecast for JNJ in 2024-03-10 to 2024-03-17"}

IBM faces stiff competition in the thriving AI market, as highlighted in the comparison between Microsoft and IBM. \n\n[Prediction & Analysis]:\nPrediction: Up by 1-2%\nAnalysis: My prediction is a modest uptick of around 1-2% in IBM's stock price for the week of 2024-02-25. I base this prediction mainly on the positive market sentiment regarding the company's recent collaboration with ISC2, alongside its well-established position in the flourishing AI industry. These two factors should contribute positively to the stock's investor appeal, outweighing concerns about the company's high debt levels and potential liquidity issues. The stock's consistent growth over the past weeks, except for the slight decrease from 2024-02-18 to 2024-02-25, provides further support for this near-term upward trend.\nKey risks to this prediction include any broader stock market downturn, unanticipated poor performance in the AI sector, or any company-specific negative news. Therefore, it's important to monitor broader market indices and related industry news to stay updated.","instruction":"Forecast for IBM in 2024-02-25 to 2024-03-03"}
