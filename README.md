# Financial-LLM-Forecaster

A modular financial signal extraction and forecasting framework built with Python and machine learning.

**Financial-LLM-Forecaster** is a simplified public version of a multi-agent financial analysis system I developed for modeling user-driven queries, extracting structured information from noisy financial data, and generating interpretable market insights.

This project highlights my approach to **quantitative research**, **feature engineering**, **predictive modeling**, and **production-oriented ML system design**.

## Key Components

### **1. Query Classification Engine**
PyTorch-based classifier that identifies user intent (forecasting, fundamentals, relations) and routes tasks to the appropriate modeling pipelines.

### **2. Financial Feature Engineering**
Domain-specific feature construction for:
- Time-series patterns  
- Volatility signals  
- Cross-sectional relations  
- Event-driven market behaviors  

### **3. Model Benchmarking & Evaluation**
Comparative evaluation of multiple ML models, including:
- LLaMA 2  
- GPT-series routing  
- Tree-based predictors  
- Lightweight financial classifiers  

Evaluation includes accuracy, calibration, error-pattern analysis, and robustness.

### **4. Forecasting Framework**
Modular forecasting components supporting:
- Traditional statistical methods  
- ML-based predictors  
- Easily extensible architectures for research experimentation  

### **5. Production-Oriented Pipeline Design**
- Clean separation of data, modeling, routing, and evaluation  
- Reproducible training workflows  
- Configurable pipeline structure for rapid iteration
